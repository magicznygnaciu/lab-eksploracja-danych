background i have an associates degree in business administration had not really had much computer programming experience study before about a year ago and generally was starting from scratch i was working as a teller and part time as a waiter before i started the program a friend of mine had joined a computer programming bootcamp and was hired at j p morgan as a java programmer almost immediately upon graduating i looked into bootcamps that covered python and found general assembly data science immersive dsi bootcamp was a good fit for me personally i applied and was accepted and

the ztm python course may be worth your while but if you know you want to go into machine learning data science most of the info from the ztm python course is also in a specific section of the ztm machine learning course the ztm machine learning bootcamp is not truly a bootcamp they cover most of what you need to know so it's great to prep for a true bootcamp but there are not the kind of

lists with tooltips maybe a summary row icons colors basically presenting data in a way that people will like to pay for currently i decided to go with a django backend and a react frontend overall i have to admit i hate frontend dev almost as much as i hate webapps still i thought react was a reasonable choice for a great user experience with a modern toolset right now the frontends authenticate against the backends and fetches data using graphql instead of traditional rest which sounded like a great idea at the time but actually i feel like this was a terrible approach when fetching data there needs to be a ton of transformation and looping over arrays done in the frontend to bringt the pieces of fetched data together in a format suitable to render tables which in my opinion is a mess fiddling with arrays in js while there is a python backend at my fingertips that could use pandas to do it in the fraction of the time but that seems just how this works i also got fed up with react it provides a lot of great advantages but honestly i am not happy having tons of packages for simple stuff that might get compromised with incompatible versions and stuff down the road also i feel bad about the packages available to create those tables in general it just feels extremely inefficient and that\\u2019s coming from someone usually writhing python overall what i like beautiful frontend

that #num# will represent a historical landmark in our recent memory it instantly split into two pre pandemic and post pandemic and like any historical landmark #num# ushered in a great variety of seismic changes everything we knew about life went upside down our goals our ambitions and priorities our notions of work and good governance the state of science and public knowledge our relationship with the environment and so many other phenomena that we never heeded to in the \\u2018old normal\\u2019 and of course in the \\u2018new normal\\u2019 this political psychological and social upheaval has also had an impact on the economy consumer behavior has changed drastically as well the lockdown and the chaos perhaps shaping in us a new sensibility of consumption everything from our habits needs preferences to our buying patterns has been reshaped by the pandemic after scientists studying the novel coronavirus and its effects data scientists are probably the most interested in what is to come and businesses like any other enterprise in #num# will be eagerly waiting to cash in on what they will discover so what have they discovered less is more an economic disruption and uncertainty that rivalled #num# \\u2019s crisis and the fear of a sudden lockdown caused people to only consume what\\u2019s essential according to a study by #link# #num# % of the participants were worried about job security while #num# % were wary of the global economic impact the caution was reflected in their spending habits as they prioritized value instead of worth saving generously the newfound sensibility was also shaped by convenience and availability given the sudden imposition of nationwide lockdowns what\\u2019s further of note \\u2014 perhaps unsurprising \\u2014 is the type of essentials that we consumed such as canned food or soup let\\u2019s take a look #link# it is hard to say whether the new sensibility \\u2014 which is great for the environment though bad for businesses \\u2014 will be cemented perhaps consumers will take their spending up a notch as the market gradually recovers until then businesses can capitalize on the new habits to which consumers have taken the consumption of entertainment news social media music art and books surged we also observed a moderate rise in cooking and fitness clearly people had the sudden urge to make a change they wished to put the time to good use brands selling these goods have a great opportunity to take hold of their market online thrives unsurprisingly online markets thrived thanks to the lockdown online businesses absolutely soared here's what we shopped online #link# however data suggests that online markets would have soared in any case according to #link# reported that #num# % avoided leaving their homes while #num# % decided to socially distance themselves even from their closest friends and relatives fear contained us it also contained work with the same study highlighting that #num# % of the workforce worked from home either partially or wholly there simply was no reason to go out and why would there be shopping online is far more convenient and safer the warning is clear as day go offline and online or miss out on a mammoth chunk of customers for businesses already online capitalize on the surge with attractive discounts and offers and since most customers seem to be online it is also time to work on your social media skills social media is quite easily the number one communication channel to reach your customers it profoundly affects people\\u2019s perception of your brand their opinion of your values your identity it has the power to influence people in swathes leverage it in fact in #num# consumers are suspicious of brands that do not have an online presence it would seem bizarre that a business operates online but is not socially active besides we don\\u2019t see any downside to not having an online presence customers love identifying with their favorite brand\\u2019s values which are depicted via tweets pictures videos and now stories or reels also social media is arguably one of the best platforms to identify your ideal customer and target him or her with personalized ads and offers hail the era of customer experience if a term could define this era's business ethos it would be personalized customer experience according to a #link# more than #num# % of customers expect their favorite brands to anticipate their needs and desires it is no wonder that customer worshipping juggernauts such as amazon and netflix are so wildly successful what fuels their success is two things first raw customer data and second powerful #link# that yield algorithms that anticipate their preferences their operation mimics the snowball effect \\u2014 the more data they collect the more strengthened the algorithms and the more strengthened the algorithms the more customers they attract which results in more data collection and on it goes other aspects that constitute an outstanding customer experience are personalized ads timed ads personalized offers human like chatbots and other communication avenues that help retain customers there were also other drivers of change in consumer behavior besides convenience and availability which we already mentioned consumers also prioritized quality and hygiene these factors literally caused them to switch brands take a look #link# the key takeaway is to embrace data or perish and the pandemic has only confirmed our conviction the best strategy is a dynamic strategy a strategy that constantly evolves and such a strategy can only be made with data analytics which takes measurable inputs and yields actionable outputs businesses that paid attention to these changes quickly altered their short

open source feature store called feast the idea behind feast is that it helps you to operationalize your features meaning it helps you build training datasets from your offline features it helps you load features into an online store in a structured way and it provides low latency access to your features in production the original design of feast was heavy weight you needed to run a big stack on kubernetes with spark we\\u2019ve been chatting to a bunch of users and the one thing we kept hearing was that they saw value in feast for productionizing their data but it was too heavy weight to own so we\\u2019ve put a lot of energy towards really simplifying feast we\\u2019ve made it as easy as a pip install you can now run feast locally if you\\u2019re just getting started with development testing but you can also deploy it to cloud providers like gcp if you want something more scalable we\\u2019d love for you to download it and try it out in your own projects we\\u2019ve got a slack

so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen created via combustion of fossil fuels nitrogen dioxide is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates and plays a role in the formation of acid rain it becomes nitric acid it's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation which can lead to a whole host of other health issues ozone is a powerful oxidant which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues it also attacks various polymers like rubber eventually causing it to crack it's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides like

by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur as well as volcanic activity it's a precursor to acid rain it becomes sulfuric acid sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic and

many bio phd folks turned ds led me to believe that a bio phd is only relevant useful for obtaining at ds job if it is accompanied by a project that involves the application of advanced statistics or actual machine learning techniques to the project this is my opinion so far #num# i struggled with my advisor a to come up with a project that allowed me to develop those skills and work toward his

which of these opportunities will be better for me in the long run i have described each opportunity more in depth below if you would like more information other questions for professional data folks in the field what is your opinion of the usefulness of a phd that is not in cs statistics math ds when applied to a ds or senior da role what is your opinion of colleagues with bio phds whom you work with in the ds role @ bio phd people who now work ds what does the landscape look like has your phd benefitted you in any way i e useful domain knowledge stats ability to get an interview the way you are treated by colleagues increased decreased opportunities payment and benefits my current opinion i have not taken the webscrape linkedin or indeed for data related to all ds da jobs approach my research into these roles however suggests to me that an m s degree may be sufficient long term most roles ask for either a ph d or an m s x years of experience i think i may be better off taking an m s and getting years of actual experience in the field moreover if i need to do some self learning to cover machine learning concepts or whatever i will have more free time to do this with an industry position compared to my ph d work i'm leaning toward accepting the offer however i welcome any comments suggestions or insight you all have with the exception of the first bullet below to note i'm not interested in arguments that fit the sunk cost fallacy no one can get any time already spent back and the time spent is not worthless because of the experience and insight gained i'm #num# if that helps all my professors are in the know about these opportunities and steps have been taken to give me the ability to make either decision i do not know how long the dissertation project would take if i accepted that project nor do i know where they profs want to publish they do know that i am interested in leaving asap and seem amenable to that i think both opportunities are equally interesting and i'm trying to ignore the fact that the industry position comes with a pay increase and likely a better work life balance i'm trying to view it through the lens of which is better long term more information about both opportunities if you're interested the industry position is a data analyst role on their continuous improvement team this company is in a position where they are growing and doing well selling machinery and software to improve logistic methods for other companies that move products i e warehousing they are accumulating data but do not have the know how to best utilize it they are even lacking etl pipelines that pull data from different departments to a centralized data warehouse and then send that data to dashboards or reporting tools i e what i'd call low hanging fruit they also have not entirely determined what kpis to track or what they want to measure moving forward they have one person with the title master data specialist and i would work with this person potentially giving me someone who could mentor me in this role what i see is a great opportunity to direct how they organize and use their data to have input on what questions are being asked and the opportunity to say that i helped build up the data team within the continuous improvement group the dissertation project is a project where i will lead the analysis of data from a large multi omic study omics is basically an approach where tissue is taken from a sample put through a big scary bio machine and hundreds to thousands of x where x is proteins genes lipids metabolites are identified and quantified these quantities are comparable across disease groups the advisor and his collaborators have multiple tissue types from hundreds of samples categorized by disease group they have data for proteins lipids metabolites etc their idea broadly is to use a network analysis approach to analyze the covariance between these x and determine clusters of related x #link# outside of the

#link# i haven't finished the degree yet but i'm far enough into it that i can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling first the good stuff eastern university puts their students first the professors administrators and admissions staff at eu have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students they usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback eu is super military friendly i'm using the post #num# #num# gi bill to fund my studies if you have #num# % gi bill then you get a degree for free and pocket at least $#num# k in stipends even if you only have #num# % gi bill like i do you'll still net around $#num# k at eastern you only need to take one class at a time to qualify as a full time student so you can collect that $#num# month stipend while only enrolled in a single class they also offer a $#num# per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel if you're using tuition assistance while serving the whole program will only cost you $#num# out of pocket which is an insanely good deal for a graduate degree everything is self directed no weekly modules if you burn the midnight oil you can finish an entire seven week course in just a week or two that's quite convenient if you're a full time working professional with an unpredictable schedule the professor's videos give a clear description on how to use programming languages i enrolled with zero programming experience but they hold your hand through the whole thing and explain in detail how it all works at a theoretical level i usually have the instructional videos open in one window and my python editor open in another so i can pause and play around with it it's an effective way to learn and there are a few drawbacks academically it's not super challenging for example all the assignments can be retaken until you get the grade you want also as an online program it's possible for an unscrupulous student to cheat their way through although i have no idea why someone would spend all this money on a degree to learn data science and then just coast through the program if you want to gain proficiency with python r statistics etc you'll have to practice writing code and crunching numbers on your own in addition to the class assignments they do however provide you with all the learning materials you need to gain proficiency the student account website isn't the most user friendly simply signing up for a new class is a drawn out cumbersome process that took me a while to figure out the learning management system they use brightspace isn't the most efficient either the bottom line i know this sounds cliche but you'll get out of this program what you put into it if you only do the bare minimum to pass each course you can pay all this money just to get a fancy diploma but lack the data science knowledge to succeed in the real world if you go the extra mile and take time to master the material on your own you'll have a strong enough foundation in data science to get into the industry gain experience and build a successful career in a lucrative field eu's program is a convenient and affordable option for working professionals who want to branch out into data science and have the motivation to work for it and now i'll answer a few frequently asked questions how much time per week would i need to put in as a student it varies depending on how much time you need to practice and how many classes you take each course is seven weeks long i've been taking one course per term while working full time as a civil engineer part time as a national guard officer and taking care of my #num# month old daughter and i still have had plenty of time to finish each class with a few weeks to spare if you plan ahead each week it's possible to balance this program with a full time job eastern university isn't as prestigious high ranking as for example ut austin or georgia tech how will employers judge a degree from eu i wouldn't worry too much about university rankings once you're in the industry and have experience no one cares where you got your degree you'll also find that many data scientists are completely self taught and have degrees in unrelated subjects some of them don't have degrees at all for example my brother attended a bottom tier open enrollment university and studied computer science for a few semesters before dropping out even though he never finished his degree he became proficient at writing code and now makes six figures as a software engineer all you have to do is get good enough at writing the code to pass a technical interview to make yourself marketable do i even need a degree for this career field isn't it possible to learn data science simply by watching youtube videos yes it is possible to learn data science on your own but the structure of a degree program makes it easier to keep a consistent study schedule it also gives you something palpable to list on a resume when you start applying for jobs as i've stated earlier many private sector tech companies are loose on degree requirements however government and military jobs stipulate certain degrees for their applicants i currently work for dod as an engineer and every time i apply for a new position within our department i have to submit my transcript along with it an ms in data science

my question i would like to quote a paper by ishawaran et al on random forests for survival analysis data in which the authors very concisely outline the difficulties of feature selection i e which variables to include in a statistical model in classical regression models and how this problem is somewhat alleviated with more advanced models further because these methods i e classical regression models e g cox ph regression even though it's semi parametric are often parametric nonlinear effects of variables must be modeled by transformations or expanding the design matrix to include specialized basis functions often ad hoc approaches such as stepwise regression are used to determine if nonlinear effects exist identifying interactions especially those involving multiple variables is also problematic this must be done by brute force examining all two way and threeway interactions e g or must rely on subjective knowledge to narrow the search in contrast these difficulties are handled automatically using forests we illustrate the ease with which rsf can uncover complex data structures through an in depth case study of the prognostic implications of being underweight overweight or obese and having severe but stable coronary artery disease investigators have noted complex patterns surrounding possible reverse causation in underweight individuals interactions with smoking and an unclear inflection point at which point increasing body mass confers increased risk some have identified a possible obesity paradox among patients with established heart disease in which increased body mass predicts better survival to clarify these issues we analyzed a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery using rsf random survival forest we identified a complex relationship between long term survival body mass renal kidney function smoking and number of internal coronary artery bypass grafts we believe our novel findings help explain some of the apparent contradictions previously reported source https arxiv org pdf #num# pdf essentially the authors claim that traditional regression models struggle with feature selection and the newer models e g bagging random forest are able to better deal with feature selection i do remember from an intro stats class the somewhat tedious process of determining which variables to include in a multiple linear regression model as the authors described i remember there was something called cp mallow's criteria in which potential variables were repeatedly included and excluded in the regression model and the value of cp mallow's criteria was monitored a final selection of variables for the model was decided on the basis of this criteria however this selection process becomes inefficient for large datasets if i understand correctly this means you would have to refit the model for many different combinations of variables resulting in a combinatorics explosion for a large number of variables like the authors mention you can also manually hard code interaction terms in the model e g log var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# etc and there an infinite such number of potential interactions improper feature selection can also result in unwanted effects such as multicollinearity the last point i would like to bring up although my knowledge of mathematics is not strong enough to fully substantiate it is that classical regression models are said to have a tendency to overfit i don't know why i have seen visual demonstrations of this but i don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this or if it's just an empirical observation and poorly generalize to new data again i don't know why and that classical regression models are only able to recognize linearly separable patterns in the data intuitively i can understand this e g draw a circle of red points and a smaller circle of blue points that fits in the red circle a single line can not separate the two colors but i don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this this brings me to my question about feature selection for large datasets with the advent of technology data is becoming bigger and bigger everyday convolution neural networks are the go to method for analyzing pictures a standard black and white picture is said to have #num# variables whereas dna is said to have even more in such instances it surely must be impossible to address feature selection as done in conventional statistical modelling please excuse my poor understanding of math but my understanding is that newer statistical models have built in methods of handling the feature selection problem for instance random forest randomly chooses different combinations of variables and sees which combinations result in better model performance the exact randomizing mechanism uncorrelated trees is said to also prevent against multicollinearity i ahve heard that the creator of the random forest algorithm leo breiman claims through theoretical statistics that random forest by definition can not over fit and has some desirable error bounds and convergence properties is this true meanwhile i have read on data science blogs i'm not going to lie that deep neural networks are able to automatically learn and consider useful combinations of features for approximating the target function am i correct all in all what i want to ask here for large datasets where sometimes the features don't have any immediate meanings e g a patient's blood pressure vs the information contained in the #num# st pixel of a photograph is there any real way to handle feature selection or is this usually taken care of by the statistical model itself e g random forest and neural networks i have seen examples online where people attempted to write a massive for loop in which they train the same model with thousands of variable

for each component in the cnn architecture i\\u2019m trying to arrive at an intuitive semantic plain english understanding of what it does i do this by asking \\u201cwhat question does this component try to answer about its input \\u201d or if the question answer analogy doesn\\u2019t apply then \\u201cwhat does this component do to its input and why \\u201d where the answer doesn't merely describe the mathematical operations e g it's just a dot product for example pooling layers answer the question \\u201cwhich feature is most salient \\u201d returning the answer similarly dropout layers \\u201cforce the neurons in the following layer to learn independently of each other \\u201d etc armed with this high level interpretation intuiting the mathematics then becomes much easier okay filters well the cnn component du jour is the convolutional filter and i\\u2019m really struggling to articulate this kind of intuition about it in other words you pass a single region of the input into the filter convolve it and out pops a single number but i really don\\u2019t understand what that number represents in general terms of course i understand that the number is the \\u201csum of the element wise products\\u201d between the input and filter matrices but that description provides no intuitive semantic understanding it doesn\\u2019t tell me what the number represents without such an understanding these filters are basically just voodoo magic now i do have a theory and it\\u2019s based on the surprising but apparently true claim that despite their name these so called convolutional filters aren\\u2019t actually doing convolution at all but rather cross correlation using that fact as a starting point here\\u2019s my theory is the number output by the filter some quantification of the degree to which the input matrix is similar to or correlated with the filter matrix for a given region of the input given that these filters are sometimes called \\u201cfeature detectors\\u201d it seems like that would make a lot of sense and here's why i think that the filter represents some pattern and if the input resembles that pattern the filter will be stimulated and output a relatively larger value indicating the strength with which said pattern is present in the input in other words the greater the similarity correlation larger the output output and the more

probability is greater than #num# we reject the transaction that is of course assuming the real world data will have similar distribution to our training set now let's say due to pandemic the behavior has changed rapidly and unexpectedly in a way that our model generally produces #num# higher probabilities this change in distribution might be different in different groups if we still decline based

been rather interesting to say the least back in december i ended up applying to do an applied data science course at various uk universities and rotman university of toronto as of thus i have only heard back from rotman and got accepted a few weeks ago it's their management analytics course last minute however i also decided to apply to rice university the reason i chose rice is mostly two fold first of all it's a school that i've heard really good things about secondly i have some friends in the texas area that i met online which i want to see if we can get a start up going it's important to note that i am a european citizen italian but i grew up most of my life as a tck third culture kid in asia hence i went to american schools my whole life and picked up much of that culture and accent with their extremely selectivity i assumed that i never even stood a chance at rice so when i got into rotman i basically set my heart on it and moved on with my life last night however i got accepted into their mds professional master's in data science course which will come out as being very similar to that of rotmans if not a bit more technical coming from an engineering background that's actually a plus as of right now i'm struggling on making my mind up on where to go toronto is technically speaking higher ranked than rice across the board however there's something about the name that seems as if when i talk to people they rank rice higher than uoft in their minds let me know if that's just my social bubble so in terms of status my brain says uoft is better but rice worst case scenario isn't a university to turn your head to with that it leads me on to why i care about status in the first place at the end of the day i couldn't care less personally i believe in the better experience and rice is currently just tipping the balances in foresight however employers and future mba programs for example may care very much about this it's important to note that i aim to graduate after #num# months and find work in the country i graduate from in the states i'll have #num# years of guaranteed work and #num# attempts at the h#num# b visa while in canada if i have an employer willing to hire me i should get the work permit with no problems my fear is that maybe in houston i'll find a job stay for #num# years then be forced to leave due to these issues granted i could always just apply for a work visa in canada after graduating from rice right in general this is the gist of things i know that i've loved living in both places albeit i'd probably prefer the southern climate both universities are relatively well known in their places of interest job opportunities should be plentiful in both areas i got slight scholarships for both so tuition is basically

finally i have two values for product because they can sell one of two products i was having a lot of trouble however with one thing since the data is unpivoted and we have data for numerous steps in the sales process there is no real easy way to filter out rows where sales is in a early step in the sales process and has no associated value for the later stages since the id column has repeating values if you just filter out the later steps in the process step column the data won't reflect properly because sales might actually be in that later stage or even closed out the sale but just filtering it out doesn't actually do anything other than hide the later stage rows how did i solve the issue i created a reference table a copy of the original table and added custom columns with if statements if process step is approved then #num# else for blank i did this five times for every process step and now i have five columns with #num# and #num# values from there i used these five columns as page level filters in power bi i filtered out any rows in the table that have a #num# for the #num# latest stages of the process step column leaving only the first two so basically if there

supervision and working conditions when you look back at the best moments of your career they won\\u2019t really include the perks or the free lunches you got instead you\\u2019ll look back and remember the motivators these are factors like recognition and achievement they mean that your work is challenging and that you\\u2019re learning about topics that you\\u2019re intrinsically

is burning under my fingernails i am currently working in a market and social research institute for a little over two years which would like to gradually finally dedicate itself to more modern solutions to deliver results before that you could find me as a market researcher in financial consulting trying to slay the spreadsheet headed hydra with python but i'd rather tell that story another day anyway if you know market research you will also know the typical researcher type of guy who still throws around piles of crosstabs and powerpoint slides and prefers to create their postscript tables based on fixed column ascii data as our company still does in parts but this industry does not sleep either and so interactive reporting formats are gradually gaining acceptance now here comes the difficulty what solution can be found to create dashboards for external customers in ad hoc study projects without much infrastructural effort it needs an environment that i can give to less code savvy people if they want to set up at least rudimentary reporting that nevertheless offers a minimum of interaction the big difficulty here is that many solutions i find on the market typically handle metric data very well but in market research there is also a lot of categorical and ordinal scaled data generated by multiple choice and matrix questions where i need for example stacked column charts of #num# matrix items with their corresponding likert scales sorted by top #num# values from the respective scale which i also need to function after drill down filtering and as reproducible as possible open source solutions are preferred in our company tableau powerbi and relatives are less attractive due to licensing costs around the corner i'd also thrown tools like metabase on a server hooked it up to a few sample databases and tried it but the internal query capabilities were too limited for the multi variable graphs i just mentioned it worked but ate up too much time for one graph prorietary tools like dapresy and displayr can inherently work very well with such data as they can even handle wide format input which of course makes importing data easier but again there are licensing costs that quickly scale along with the projects at the moment i'm thinking about covering this use case with r flexdashboards and giving my colleagues a library that provides typical functions for us so that we can at least generate a viable product but i refuse to believe that there isn't a more scalable solution around i would be very happy to hear of any good solutions

strong interest in computer science and programming i took an introductory class in computer science java based and loved it and did pretty well i also realized just how useful even a basic

continue improving my data analysis skills by taking linear algebra and a class called mathematics for numerical computation and machine learning which has mostly focused on topics in linear algebra and probability relevant to machine learning i e eigen stuff singular value decomposition different probability distributions etc all of the assignments for the latter class have been in python which i am loving so far and have been using for the aforementioned curve fitting analysis in my research so my question is for someone with a basic to intermediate understanding of programming and computer

the distribution of the *test statistic* in this case the group means is normally distributed? my gut is that only the latter must be satisfied for example, if the exam consists of 4 questions it's

refer to this catalogue of algorithms in the same way an alchemist from the middle ages would refer to a book of alchemical recipes they\\u2019re not quite sure which recipes will work or why, but they know some of them work some of the time so they try to pattern-match the current situation to previous situations they\\u2019ve encountered, and try to remember which recipe seemed to work then the idea of **not** doing this, of **not** reaching for one of their pre-cooked algorithmic ready meals, of stopping and examining the problem in detail from its foundations and maybe even coming up with their own method of solving it yes, from scratch! , seems to fill them with the uttermost horror and the idea that a problem might even have an **analytic** solution, if you just think about it a bit, is simply too much for many of them to bear one who i currently work with calls such an approach \\u201cpseudoscience\\u201d i suspect this propensity for crowbarring pre-memorized algorithms into unsuitable situations has two underlying causes: a a lack of practice at mathematical modelling which is a different skill from data science , and b a lack of comfort with probability and statistics i\\u2019ve had data scientists stare at me, dumbfounded, when i tell them the correlation coefficient only measures straight-line relationships, and will be useless for nonlinear e g u-shaped relationships i\\u2019ve had a data scientist tell me with confidence that the correct way to calculate the probability of a and b happening is always, under all circumstances, to multiply the probability of a by the probability of b when i pointed out that this obviously wasn\\u2019t true if a and b were tightly correlated and that they might be missing something important i was trying to see if they were aware of the concept of conditional probability , they had a kind of meltdown and started questioning whether all of probability theory was wrong to those who say, \\u201cbut data scientists are trained to use the algorithms that they\\u2019re taught, not the weird stuff you\\u2019re talking about\\u201d, i say i\\u2019m afraid that just isn\\u2019t good enough your job is to extract meaning from data that is the task you are being hired for if you are flummoxed by basic probability theory, or are uncomfortable coming up with your own algorithms, you are going to be eaten alive by those who are comfortable with both for example, i used to work for a debt collection company a few years back and our data was horrifically sporadic and noisy the data science team up north used to just shake their heads and say there was little they could do as the data was such a mess it didn\\u2019t fit into the logistic regression algorithm they were obsessed with, and was therefore unusable once, we were on the verge of losing a client because we couldn\\u2019t figure out a way to contact the people most likely to pay their debts it was regarded as a foregone conclusion that we would lose this client however, i was able to use a na\\u00efve bayes classifier written in vba and excel because we weren\\u2019t allowed python in our southern branch for \\\"security reasons\\\" to assign log-likelihoods of payment to individuals based on about 10-12 features the fact that these log-likelihoods were almost certainly \\u201cinaccurate\\u201d didn\\u2019t matter what mattered was that, using this rough metric of quality, you could rank the individuals in descending order of likelihood and just skim off the top few thousand then only these would be sent to our call centre, instead of them having to call hundreds of thousands of debtors at random because the edict from the data science team was that the data was unusable our debt collections on that client shot up by 270% after i did that needless to say, this reflected very well on me and very poorly on the data science team up north, and my bonus reflected this 2 choosing complex solutions before checking if simple ones will do i get it you spent hundreds of hours learning about random forests, xgboost, neural networks, stochastic gradient descent, k-means clustering, simulated annealing, and god-knows-what else you want to start using these algorithms somewhere, anywhere, to make all that time worthwhile but have you stopped to consider that maybe the particular problem you\\u2019re working on right now actually doesn\\u2019t require\\u2026 well\\u2026 any of that? how about, instead of spending a month or two trying to fit a neural network to a noisy dataset including such joys as deciding how many layers it should have, how many nodes per layer, what the activation function should be, whether it should have dropout, etc and then telling me that you didn\\u2019t accomplish anything because the data is so bad, you instead tried drawing a **straight line** through the data instead? the former takes ages and is almost guaranteed to fail, the latter takes 10 minutes and is almost guaranteed to succeed fair enough, the fit isn\\u2019t great, but it at least it gives you something to extrapolate from, and something to show to management / clients if deadlines suddenly shrink and you know what else? while you were spending the 10 minutes coding that baby-level linear regression, your muscle memory probably started kicking in, and now you remember that, come to think of it, there\\u2019s something called the , in which you can explicitly specify the curve family that you think the curve should be from, and then it just optimizes for the parameters and so on if you\\u2019ve just made a beeline straight for the most complex thing you can think of, you\\u2019re going to just fumble around aimlessly for ages and get nothing done in general, you should always start with the simplest, laziest solution to any problem this is because: a it\\u2019s fast, b it\\u2019s easy, c it\\u2019s low stress, d it gets you \\u201cwarmed up\\u201d to the problem, so that any future ideas for complex improvements will occur more easily to you, e it lets you break the problem into chunks, each of which is easier to solve than the whole, f it might be all that you\\u2019re able to do anyway, given the quality of the data, and g while management / clients may throw around big important-sounding words like \\u201coptimization\\u201d, \\u201cmachine learning\\u201d, and \\u201calgorithms\\u201d, there is a precisely 0% chance that they mean these phrases in the same way you mean them a \\u201cprediction algorithm\\u201d can be a straight line to them, and a sigmoid curve will blow their minds start simple, then add complexity if necessary 3 snobbishness about excel excel is one of the most widely-used data science platforms in the world i feel sorry for any readers who think it is beneath them, or who think it somehow isn\\u2019t a \\u201creal\\u201d data science platform you are missing out on such an opportunity you can write your algorithm out step-by-step in the cells for all the world to see, so they can pick apart the formulas and understand them that makes it great for demonstrating your ideas to non-experts, or even to other experts who are struggling to follow your line of thinking writing out your planned approach in this methodical way also acts as an amazing sanity-check for yourself on your ideas before you hurl yourself into your jupyter notebook and start waving scikit-learn and pytorch around and spouting nonsense you can even code in excel if you desperately want to i once wrote a k-means clustering algorithm in vba for god\\u2019s sake, with a big juicy macro button in the sheet for the user to press i can assure you there is nothing that management / clients love more than a big button to push, and nothing that they hate more than an unfamiliar environment i e giving them a presentation which involves scrolling through a jupyter notebook that they don't understand summary these are the main problems i see with data scientists i\\u2019m sure this post will get downvoted into oblivion, but if you want advice from the guy who\\u2019s been in your shoes and is now doing the hiring, then i would recommend the following: \\u00b7 get good at , not \\u201cdata science\\u201d this will let you take the vague bs that managers say they want and turn it into a solvable mathematical problem that mirrors what they actually meant additionally, most company data is of too poor quality to use in most fancy data science algorithms anyway you can call yourself a data scientist if that's the buzzword that gets you the job, but this is the underlying skill you are likely to need \\u00b7 get your probability & statistics sharp i\\u2019m talking razor-sharp not the fancy bs about \\u201cbayesian reasoning\\u201d or any of that other crap, but the fundamentals are you happy with what an expected value is? are you happy with conditional probability? do you understand that subtracting the probability of an event happening from 1 is equal to the probability of it not happening? are you happy with the probabilistic equivalents of ? i hope you got 66 5% because that\\u2019s what the answer is what about things like simple random simulations? could you code 10,000 simulations of a random walk with adjustable parameters? this stuff should be like breathing to

results of my recent comparative sentiment analysis of fox news and cnn on twitter after scraping 500 recent tweets from each news outlet and analyzing the data using python and the nrc lexicon, i found that fox news tends to express more fear in their messaging, while cnn expresses more trust &#x200b; this finding is indicative of the broader republican and democratic narratives in american politics the republican party tends to emphasize issues related to law and order, national security, and immigration, which are often framed in terms of threats and dangers this rhetoric appeals to voters who prioritize safety and security and are more likely to see the world as a dangerous place on the other hand, the democratic party tends to focus on issues related to social justice, equity, and inclusivity, which are often framed in terms of fairness and equality this rhetoric appeals to voters who prioritize social issues and are more likely to see the world as a diverse and interconnected place &#x200b; by analyzing sentiments expressed by the two networks, not what people said about them, my analysis offers valuable insights into how american media and politics are shaped by these different narratives as we approach the 2024 presidential election, understanding these nuances in messaging will be crucial for anyone interested in american politics and media

freshman year in college i was hired quite quickly, while studying pre-med, to be a business intelligence engineer at a regional bank, per the recommendation of another employee who was a classmate of mine and was familiar with my extensive programming background after a year of being there doing etl, software engineering, and other data engineering functions, my mentor, the bi architect stormed out of the office after being refuse a loa to care for sick family in india i was then promoted to her role where i stayed for another 3 years during my time there i would routinely be called a child and was denied a raise or bonus every year because \\\"you're just a college student the quality of your work and workload don't matter you should be thankful i'd even employ someone your age at a position that reports directly to the cfo\\\" i took it in stride, but i was only getting $50k the people who worked under me as bi engineers were getting 100-150 each with significantly less work, less executive visibility, and zero need for making regular presentations to the board of directors, like i did eventually i grew tired of the abuse i was working 60 hour weeks while taking between 24-29 credit hours at uni i was literally signed into work and working through class, getting up early every day, weekday or weekend, to run data loads and make sure they were accurate even though i'd automated it all and automated validation my boss demanded i do it this was my role when i was an engineer and the architect did not do it, yet even after i was promoted and new engineers were hired, he still made me do it i was then poached by a pair of small business sister companies that 4 of my friends from uni worked at i was offered a 50% raise i was conflicted about doing it, but resentful for how i was treated i told my boss about it and he said he wouldn't match the salary and to leave that night i got a call on my personal cell from the cfo who said if i stayed, he'd double my salary, ensure i was never called a child again, and would received raises and bonuses as my work qualified me for unfortunately, i didn't believe him and had already accepted the new job i then became the director of development at one company and the database architect at the other i quickly found out that the job i was hired for wasn't at all what i was told it'd be and ended up having to trash a massive amount of my predecessor's work, which was completely unusable entirely on my own, i created a javascript framework to suit my needs and wrote a complex web application, node js backend, and a set of ios/android/windows apps using the microsoft uwp, as well as the necessary underlying database everything was tested thoroughly and documented not only inside the code, but in the azuredevops wiki where i also kept my repos this took me a year and a half to do as i had no web development experience, much less web apps, and i had to program extremely complex mathematics like rasch analytics that was used for objectively assessing a student in any field, on any criteria, using pre-input questions, and a set of multiple choice answers it was primarily a medical research company, as was the sister company at the sister company, i consolidated their 9 individual mysql dbs into 3 and gave them a prod, test, and dev environment, which they didn't have as they did everything in prod 5 minutes after deploying all my work, which was months ahead of schedule, i was called into the owners office and fired for \\\"missing all deadlines\\\" i was in tears, but didn't fight back, collected my stuff and left a bit over an hour later, i received a recording from one of my now-ex-coworkers with a 34 minute rant from the owner's wife about how she \\\"fired the f@gg0t and god's gonna bless the company now\\\" they hired an intern to replace me with zero experience the intern promptly deleted the ado wiki and repos, not knowing what they were, created a new environment for her to work in, the deployed the environment into dev, stage, and prod, completely wiping my work from the company i had a copy, of course, but i didn't give it to them they also denied me unemployment and told the unemployment office i was fired for \\\"being sexually aggressive with coworker\\\", and \\\"missing all my deadlines\\\" since i did not mention this already, they had fired the other gay guy in the office 2 weeks before me and used the same excuse i had never brought up my sexuality to them before, but all my coworkers had their partners over for lunch one day and of course my college friends were also friends with my boyfriend and brought him along without checking with me first, which effectively outed me and cost me my job back on topic, the company was sued by the unemployment office for falsifying my separation documents, as i was happy to send them the recording i was given, and the company is now long since out of business it may well be the one time karma did anything for me in my life i then got a job at the university i graduated from as a professor of computer science and i did that for a few years while doing that, i was hired to be a software engineer by a consulting company after 3 months of working there, i completed a huge project in python, creating a behavioral driven development framework prior to this, the company employed thousands of qa devs, all they did was write tests for business admins all day, every day the process was complex and extremely wasteful, with the bas writing multiple pages for each and every test my framework condensed this process into the bas having to only write a handful of sentences in basically plain english, saving a ton of time cigna was so happy, they gave me any position i wanted and i wanted to be a data architect again cigna then put me in as the lead data architect for their opioid data i did that for a year and a half before having a fight with management they wanted me to falsify data to help them win a lawsuit against a group of doctors i refused, as did my team, and i ended up leaving the cigna account i stayed at the same consulting company and went to work for the state of puerto rico as the lead data architect for their disaster recovery efforts and i stayed there for 2 years i then decided to move to washington and got approval from everyone at the project unfortunately after i moved, the project then revoked my relocation authorization despite having no authority to do so i tried to fight it as it was a clear act of retaliation for a complaint i put in, but in the end, it's at-will employment they also attempted to deny me unemployment, which was during the covid period, and successfully did so for 1 5 years in the end, i got before a judge and the judge sided with me, but refused to give me the bonus money that everyone else got from the state and feds i had a court date for that money too, but they waited till 5 days before the hearing to tell me and scheduled it for when i was in louisiana for my father's funeral i called to reschedule and they said they did it, but turns out they didn't and the courts called me a no-show and denied me for the next year and a half, i was unemployed despite countless apps and interviews during that time i worked as a freelancer and a contractor i specifically worked on covid data i've talked about my work there before on this sub, but it doesn't go over well, so i'm not gonna rehash it i picked up a lot of other temp jobs during that time, mostly working with medical data i also went and got a micromasters in machine learning cause i felt like ai/ml was my weakest skills in the field i then got a job at another consulting company i mostly worked as a data architect in medical research during that time i was then caught up in the mass layoffs since then, i've put in quite literally thousands of applications sometimes i get callbacks and surges in interviews, sometimes i got months without hearing a word i've had truly infuriating experiences with hiring managers and recruiters for example, i had a job set up by a friend at his employer and when i talked to the recruiter, he asked about my experience with a number of different technologies being a microsoft shop and me being a microsoft specialist, i had significant experience with all of them 7-12 years, depending on which one it was the recruiter then told me things like \\\"well it's a shame you don't have any experience with them we can't hire you without experience with them\\\" i tried over and over to explain i do, , but i got nowhere i had an interview with a major league baseball team recently and i was repeatedly told by the recruiters i was their top candidate first thing out of the cto's mouth when she she's my face is \\\"oh, you're just a child you couldn't possibly have any experience \\\" she made off-hand comments about my age throughout the interview later i was rejected for \\\"not having experience working without a team\\\" even though we addressed that in the interview where i explained multiple times that i primarily work without a team &#x200b; at this point, i'm at a loss on what to do it's infuriating i have no black marks on my history, numerous glowing references, 6 degree 4 undergrad, 2 masters with 3 minors and a new grad program in music at berklee i'm currently pursuing i have excellent interpersonal skills though i can come across wrong on text by accident i've had my resume reviewed by countless professionals, who have mostly left the resume alone, as they're happy with it minor changes have been made in things like order and arrangements i've been through numerous interview training programs to evaluate how i present myself and my experience i've been told i'm doing things the way i'm supposed to, that i'm presenting myself well, as experienced, capable, as excited to to bring my experience to the team and learn new things from them minor changes were made here and there, but that's it at this point, i have to find a job in the next 5 week or i will be homeless i'll lose my pets i've already stopped being able to fill my cancer medications medicaid won't cover them &#x200b; i'm currently weighed down from over $1 million in medical bills from when someone attempted to murder me for being bisexual in 2016 it left me with chronic pain problems that i have to pay for out of pocket as medicaid won't cover any pain clinics around here, nor the medications fentanyl patches i'm also paying the overwhelming majority of the $3200 rent for my house, plus another $600 a month in internet and utilities my ex/roommate is supposed to split it with me evenly, but he hasn't done so in at least a year, claiming i \\\"owe\\\" him money for this and that, but he can't ever explain what it all is i'm struggling hard &#x200b; i don't understand what's going on at all i know i have a history of kinda rolling over and taking the

did i have an undergrad and masters in statistics/data science, and have >7 years work experience in analytical roles however i am thinking about other areas in tech i can pivot towards the reason i chose to go down the data science path was because at the time, data science was touted as having a lot of demand, and also i found it interesting and i did really well in an undergrad paper i took for it which made me want to specialise and select it as my major however after entering the job market, and working for a few years, i came to realise there aren't really any quality roles for data science note i am in the australia/nz region , and most roles are just glorified analyst positions don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being an analyst, but i don't particularly like just building dashboards all day or worse, working with excel or other analysts' excels, which due to poor workflows can be an absolute mess i also don't like \\\"insights\\\" - i like investigating and coming up with evidence-based conclusions and recommendations, but often this is not what stakeholders are after, they are after \\\"storytelling with data\\\" to razzle-dazzle them and prop up what they were already planning on doing in the first place i did get to build and deploy some machine learning models however, which i enjoyed, but there isn't much demand for it which is understandable, i fully get that companies want to focus on things that add business value so now i'm thinking about other roles i might be considered/eligible for i have applied for entry-level data engineering roles as that is a related job family, but have not been successful with any as i think recruiters probably think i have too much experience and am too old i am not sure whether that would also be the case for cybersecurity and whether it's worth trying to go down this path? i know nothing is certain in this life, but would really appreciate some honest opinions before spending time and money trying to do certifications etc if i did try to pivot towards this area i would like to build up my knowledge and skills on the technical side as i think this is really important , but would want to try to get into grc roles and why cyber? i think it's a really interesting area, and it suits my analytical and investigative mindset i have also been working in financial services, which is a heavily

that the residuals are not constant and not normally distributed box-cox transformation was already used, lamba was 1 99 but it did not improve the model upon reviewing a time series text, i learned that i need to create a dummy variable i looked at the observations where the pattern breaks in january and classified them as \\\"1\\\", with the others as zero i estimated my model again and it

do you have any suggestions? what types of interventions exist? i placed \\\"1\\\" for the first few weeks of january, then \\\"0\\\" when i see that sales have reached their normal level to test for stationarity, i used the augmented dickey-fuller test and found that the data was not stationary therefore, i differenced the time series and checked for stationarity again using the adf test next, i decomposed the time series into its seasonal, trend, and residual components and plotted the results i then fit a sarima model using auto arima and checked its diagnostic tests for accuracy additionally, i performed a box-ljung test to check for autocorrelation in the residuals and a jarque-bera test for normality box-ljung was fine, but jarque-bera was not i then added a dummy variable for intervention analysis to account for outliers or extreme values in the data i fit a second sarima model using the dummy variable and checked its diagnostic tests for accuracy however, yi found

sense of its business value my stakeholders are hesitant rightfully so to simply apply the model's insights to their campaigns without a test in the past i've seen people do the following: * create a decile plot and get the average response value post campaign the x-axis here is binned probabilities i e 0- 1, 1- 2, etc the expectation here is that as the bin values increase so should the average response value response is a binary variable so the average would represent the % of folks who responded this is kinda similar to a calibration plot imo * take a marketing campaign that's about to go live and random assign people to groups one group is random selection of campaign members emulates a control , another is a low probability bin and another is a high probability bin the two probability bins emulate a treatment, but there isn't a treatment applied the internet talks about lift, cumulative gains plots, etc i can include those, but i see those as evaluation tools for data

here are 5 tips for becoming a data scientist: 1 learn the foundational skills: to become a data scientist, you need to have a solid foundation in statistics, mathematics, and programming you should be comfortable with at least one programming language such as python, r, or sql and have a good understanding of statistics and linear algebra 2 learn by doing: practice your skills by working on real-world data science problems this can be done by participating in kaggle competitions, working on personal projects, or contributing to open source projects building a portfolio of projects is an excellent way to showcase your skills to potential employers 3 stay up-to-date with industry developments: data science is a rapidly evolving field, and it's essential to stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques follow industry blogs, attend conferences, and read research papers to stay current with the latest trends 4 get comfortable with data manipulation and visualization: a significant part of a data scientist's job is data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization get comfortable with tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to manipulate and visualize data 5 build a strong professional network: networking is critical in any field, and data science is no exception attend industry events, join data science communities online, and participate in online forums to connect with other data scientists building a strong network can lead to job opportunities and collaborations down the line\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Education\"],\n [\"amd gpu for pytorch? hi, i'm

books on tiktok the dataset i have by far doesn't include all the currently popular tiktok books, so for now, i just have a list of 19 books that have done well on tiktok, with their viewcounts there are probably more, but i had to make a list myself of what i know for sure are famous books i want to use their viewcounts to set a baseline for what is considered popular on tiktok and what is not considered popular however, the viewcounts all lie pretty far apart they are the following numbers: 66089172, 909551, 14159253, 5771561, 68456152, 20982050, 6767132, 61012995, 39505320, 1299157,

distributed, i don't think i can use those i then considered using the mean - 3 times the standard deviation, but this gave me a lower bound of zero, meaning that all books would be considered tiktok famous i also tried using the 25 percentile - 1 5 times the interquartile range, but he same thing happened right now i am thinking i could just use the lowest number of the list, since i know that one is tiktok famous so ones with even slightly more views will be considered famous as well, but this feels like it's very wrong, statistically speaking, so i was wondering on your opinion on this,

because this is not always possible, it is advised to validate the values at the ingest stage 2 testing a value within a single record with set-level sanity is called fact-checking when working with big data, we must test the attributes of the set we have the set can contain data from a specific operational system, a model, or the output of an etl process we want to verify a set of characteristics that it possesses, regardless of where it came from these are statistics like the following: the data are expected to be generated by a particular distribution the average, variance, or median value will almost certainly fall within a predetermined range this column\\u2019s average ought to fall within this range with a 95% probability take a look at a poker table where the hands that are dealt to the players are displayed yes, gaming websites also have bi in this instance, the anticipated hand distribution can be pre-calculated 3 like factual exactness tests, we look at the qualities of a bunch of records for history-based set level mental soundness only in this particular instance do we lack a real-world source we have access to the data set\\u2019s past: the same set of data as it has evolved over time we can test to see if the current data set is consistent with the baseline by using this historical data as a baseline for its characteristics learning the baseline improves both the validity of the baseline values and the test\\u2019s outcome we conduct the same statistical test, but because of the baseline to which we compare were basically statistically deduced from the historical data and are only accurate with a certain probability; we run an additional risk to gets it more accurate **conclusion** the iterative process of developing, delivering, and maintaining any data science product is outlined in a data science lifecycle since no two information science projects are indistinguishable, their life cycles vary also nevertheless, we are able to envision a comprehensive lifecycle that encompasses some of the most typical steps in data science the data science lifecycle in its broadest sense includes the application of statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to produce more accurate prediction models a scorecard with low data quality indicates that the data are of low value, of poor quality, can be misleading, and may lead to poor decision-making that could be detrimental to the organization on the other hand, data of lower quality frequently does not track all of the variables that have an impact or is

about my studies better which is data science , where i perform introductory work for small - to middle businesses for this project, i am working to see whether it is possible to create meaningful clusters from sensor data this data is from elders, and the goal of the clusters is to group them into groups with the same 'care'-indication how much care they need the data i've gotten are from sensor movement, doors, inactivity, smoke, etc , and alarms smoke, inactivity, panic, open door, etc i have this data per user, for 1 single month the goal is to **not** make a 'dynamic' model, and therefore see shifts in care needed, but to give it somewhat of a starting point of in what 'care'-cluster they are in that given month hopefully my explanation makes sense : ---------- for preprocessing, i did the following: - filter out outliers way to many alarms and sensors detected in 1 day - decide whether an sensor/alarm happened at night or during the day - summed all sensor/alarms respectively per user i have per sensor/alarm, per part-of-day, how often that respective sensor/alarm occurred that month - minmaxscaled those values to make sure the ranges are the same movement sensor happens way more often than a smoke alarm - lastly, added weights to the columns which **might** indicate more care-needed these indications are decided by my the ones that hired me ---------- this left me with 19 features to fit my clustering model on i decided to use kmeans, since it is something i am a bit familiar with and is the most intuitive after fitting the model, i am experiencing 2 difficulties: 1 a low silhouette score 0 293 and imbalanced clusters 2 i cannot interpret/understand my clusters as an unexperienced data scientist, my guesses for problem 1 is that my clusters are just not good however, i do not know how to fix this what i already tries to do: - reduce the amount of features therefore leave out certain sensors which do not indicate a lot of care-needed - increase the number of clusters - write an optimalization script for optimal weights all of this, sadly, does not seem to increase it for problem 2 , i have tried the following: - perform pca however, my pc are not good 3 pc's explain 50 percent of all variance - plot all features as boxplots per cluster this just seems like a dead-end ---------- simply, you can say i am

post after seeing a yt video that discussed about the harsh reality of data science since this page doesn't allow video links i mention core points mentioned in it &#x200b; * ds role is not exact it varies from company to company, so that one may find difficulty in finding the right skills that help to build a portfolio or to ace in career * this role is more time consuming and even after spending alot of time and effort one could be still at the same point without any progress since the projects depends upon data, we have to consider quality, quantity etc * most of the data scientists works under a corporate, which is highly profit-oriented and it may restrict the freedom to experiment with data and also demands for profitable solutions which isn't practically feasible always so it basically makes a scientist to work like an engineer * force fitting- i really have no idea about this since ai/ds/ml has become fancy companies just hire lure professionals just to attract investors and vcs to show off that they too are working in ai/ds projects but in reality, the company has almost nothing to do with these roles just like a golden handcuff they just make those professionals to work as a data analysts or swes which may ruin the career of those professionals, wasting their time and effort * i think this one normal more projects will fail or dropped due to some circumstances like lack of funding, recession, lack of reliable data etc which may seen like a failure of an experiment i know could be really different for different countries and companies and from the name itself, we can say that ds is a corporate scientist who works in an office setup instead of a lab failing in experiments, dealing with uncertainty, time consuming, lots of learning and hardwork are the part of this role **it would be useful if some other challenges that one could face as a data scientist are mentioned by you people ** p s :- since i'm an amateur, i just wanted to know whether

hi, i am working on a project for my probability and statistics class and i am a bit confused on how to continue i am analysing a dataset of all premier league games from the 2010/11 season to the 2019/20 season what i am trying to do is analyse the conversion rate goals scored per game/shots taken per game and create a distribution i am not sure if i should use a normal distribution or a binomial distribution as the conversion rate is technically a proportion of success divided by trials so far this what i have tried but i am not sure if i am going about this correctly firstly i tried using a normal distribution as when i divide the goals per game/shots taken per game i get continuous values, expect for some zeros which are the games where no goals were scored however the data is not completely normal, so i artificially normalised by doing log 1 goals per game/shots taken per game while it did not create a huge difference, the data is more normal now would i just create a normal distribution and find the mean and variance using the values given by the log transformation? the other approach i took was using the binomial distribution as my population is large and it approximates the normal distribution firstly i used e x mu np var x np 1-p but i was not sure if this was correct because this would be a distribution of the number of successes, which is the goals scored but that is not what i want to analyse, i want to analyse the conversion rate so instead i tried using the proportion random variable p x/n where x is the number of successes, goals scored mu p var x p 1-p /n i would just like some advice on which approach is the best and makes the sense for what i am trying to do any help is appreciated and thanks in advance\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Projects\"],\n [\"m1 chip, tensorflow & docker i am able to run a docker image with my m1 chip, and i'm able to import tensorflow locally on my m1 chip what i can't do for the life of me is build and run a docker image that pip installs tensorflow any version past 2 6 0, i have tried the unofficial wheel and it works, but my other dependencies require a higher version of tensorflow , while using my m1 chip if anyone has any updated suggestions please let me know, as this issue seems to have quietened down since mid last year\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Projects\"],\n [\"learn everything about data from zero to hero hello guys i can help you learn : data science data analysis machine learning \\u2026 please dm me for more information\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Education\"],\n [\"probit or logistic regression?

last but not least, lists of tasks most likely do not capture all requirements in a given occupation for instance \\\"making someone feel cared for\\\" can be an essential part of a job but might be neglected in such a list # take-away and implications gpt models have the world in a frenzy - rightfully so nobody knows whether 19% of knowledge work gets heavily automated or if it is only 10% as the dust settles, we will begin to see how the ecosystem develops and how productivity in different industries can be increased time will tell whether foundational llms, specialized smaller models, or vertical tools built on top of apis will be having the biggest impact in any case, these technologies have the potential to create unimaginable value for the world at the same time, change rarely happens without pain i strongly believe in human ingenuity and our ability to adapt to change all in all, the study - flaws aside - represents an honest attempt at gauging the future efforts like this and their scrutiny are our best shot at navigating the future well, or we all get chased out of the city by pitchforks jokes aside! what an exciting time for science and humanity! as always, i really enjoyed making this for you and i sincerely hope you found value in it! if you are not subscribed to the newsletter yet, ! i send out a thoughtful 5-minute email every week to keep you in the loop about machine learning research and the data economy *thank you for reading and i see you next week \\u2b55!* **references:** \\\\[1\\\\]\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Discussion\"],\n [\"is ai the end of data science how much of an impact will ai have on the data science world?

support, database administration at a non-profit and then 2 years doing some financial data analysis at a small investment consulting firm in november, i received a job offer for a ds & de rotational

continued in my job search because i would prefer to start working earlier and i also want to keep the door open to more opportunities given the way things are in the market right now i have applied

discouraged from moving a coefficient, unless there's a clear gain to it in other words, the model shouldn't pick up very minor variations, and certainly shouldn't flip signs of coefficients due to

volcano erupted and buried the city of pompeii what very few people know is that multiple cities were also destroyed in the incident one of these cities was herculaneum we can think of herculaneum as the beverly hills of pompeii the city was full of marvelous villas and estates one of the more impressive ones belonged to caesar\\u2019s father-in-law it goes without saying, the guy was very powerful, well-connected, and super-rich estate of caesar\\u2019s father-in-law inside his estate was a giant library full of scrolls from the greek and roman times when the villa was destroyed, the heat of the lava carbonized turning to charcoal without burning the scrolls this has preserved them for almost 2000 years since the 18th century, different groups tried to dig up the scrolls to date, more than 1800 scrolls have been excavated and most-likely there are many more under ground some people speculate that his library might even contain scrolls from the library of alexandria that burned down a few years before from these scrolls, we might discover completely new philosophical schools, scientific secrets of the greeks, and *heck!* maybe drafts of the bible with gpt watermarks on them however, there is a catch!find quite frankly, the scrolls have more resemblance with a cigarette bud than a roll of papyrus herculaneum scroll looking at the image above, it is needless to say that simply unrolling them is not really an option in the 17 hundreds, an italian monk painstakingly tried to unroll some of the scrolls over several decades the result was mostly papyrus confetti he managed to uncover a few intact fragments that had philosophical texts written in greek on them this is obviously not scalable and would destroy most of the texts however, if we could read the scrolls this would more than double the amount of text that was handed down to us from the greek and roman times the value of that is obviously hard to overstate! *but, if we cannot unroll the scrolls, how are we supposed to find what\\u2019s written on them?* **how to read the scrolls without opening them** the herculaneum scrolls are not the first carbonized scrolls to be found in 1970, a number of 2000-year-old scrolls were discovered in the en-gedi oasis close to the dead sea with no italian monks at hand and the foresight that opening the scrolls would destroy them dr seals from the university of kentucky pioneered a method called *virtual unwrapping * it allows us to read the scrolls without opening them first, a high-resolution ct scan is created of each scroll the scan creates digital slices from the scroll the slices are created lengthwise, similar to how a cucumber is cut now, in order to perform the virtual unwrapping a sheet of the scroll is traced along the cross-sections in the image above, you can see an animation of how this is done cross-section by cross-section until a connected piece of the scroll is extracted these connected pieces are then virtually flattened in order to read the text see video below *so far so good why can we not just do the same with the scrolls from herculaneum?* there are a few challenges with applying this technique to the herculaneum scrolls on the one hand, the scrolls are very tightly wrapped and generally in pretty bad shape on the other hand, the ink in the herculaneum scrolls is radiolucent this means that x-rays pass through the ink the same way they pass through the papyrus as a result, the ink, in the ct scans, is not visible to the human eye but there is good news it has been shown that neural networks can pick up on subtle patterns in the scans that are created by the ink \\\\[2\\\\] next, we will look at how neural networks are being trained on the scans and how to win the price

using the order id as the primary key using this data i can look up stuff like which orders were returned by people who have checked out the size guide i can then enrich the data further with return reasons which are in a separate database this is done using python and pandas also the calculation of return rates is done in python, but i could probably do it faster in excel 2 i wrote a python

your choices are: 1 high-density housing this should be built if the population is significantly expanding 2 low-density housing this should be built if the population is \\u201caffluent\\u201d and there is demand for large family housing 3 train station there are potentially a lot of commuters in the town and building a train station could take pressure off the roads but how will you identify commuters? 4 religious building there is already one place of worship for catholics in the town is there demand for a second church if so, which denomination? , or for a different religious building? 5 emergency medical building not a full hospital, but a minor injuries centre this should be built if there are many injuries or future pregnancies likely in the population 6 something else? whichever you choose, you must justify it from the data provided to you and argue it is a priority against other choices ** b ** which one of the following options should be invested in? 1 employment and training if there is evidence for a lot of unemployment, we should retrain people for new skills 2 old age care if there is evidence for increasing numbers of retired people in future years, the town will need to allocate more funding for end of life care 3 increase spending for schooling if there is evidence of a growing population of schoolaged children new births, or families moving in to the town , then schooling spend should increase 4 general infrastructure if the town is expanding, then services waste collection; road maintenance, etc will require more investment &#x200b; **hints** in order to address these two questions, it is suggested that some of the analysis you undertake is: 1 examine the age distribution age pyramid of the population is it growing or shrinking? will there be more retired aged people in the future, more school-aged children, more young people, etc 2 examine unemployment trends are certain ages more likely to be unemployed than others 3 examine religious affiliations are any religions growing, or shrinking? are there any newer religions that are increasing in numbers? 4 examine the divorce and marriage rate this might impact how you think about housing 5 examine the occupancy level how many people per house and determine if existing housing is being under or over-used 6 examine the number of university students all of these are commuters since there are no universities in the town are there any other professions that are likely to be commuters? 7 what is the birth rate and death rate for the town? these are merely suggestions, there are plentiful other analyses that could be undertaken that will be discussed in the videos and in class ultimately, your answers to a and b must be justified from the census data, and argued by balancing the different needs of the population and supported through statistics and where appropriate, hypothesis testing as such, this is a \\u201creal\\u201d exercise but based on artificial data\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Projects\"],\n [\"how much of a need is an nvidia gpu?

**soulsgym** there are really two parts to this project the first one is **warning: if you want to try this gym, be sure that you have read the documentation and understood everything if not handled properly, you can get banned from multiplayer ** below, you can find a video of an agent training in the game the game runs on 3x speed to accelerate training you can also watch the video on &#x200b; *processing video o6ctdppeo8xa1 * at this point, only the first boss in dark souls iii is implemented as an environment nevertheless, soulsgym can easily be extended to include other bosses in the game due to their similarity, it shouldn't be too hard to even extend the package to elden ring as well if there is any interest in this in the ml/ds community, i'd be happy to give the other ones a shot ; **soulsai** the second part is this is necessary since the simulator at the hard of soulsgym is a game that does not expose any apis and has to be hacked instead crashes and other instabilities are rare, but can happen when training over several days at this moment, soulsai implements apex style dqn and ppo, but since ppo is synchronous, it is less robust to client crashes etc both implementations use redis as communication backend to send training samples from worker clients to a centralized training server, and to broadcast model updates from the server to all clients for dqn, soulsai is completely asynchronous, so that clients never have to stop playing in order to perform updates or send samples &#x200b; *processing img 9m060w00r8xa1 * note: i have not implemented more advanced training algorithms such as rainbow etc , so it's very likely that one can achieve faster convergence with better performance furthermore, hyperparameter tuning is extremely challenging since training runs can easily take days across multiple machines # does this actually work? yes, it does! it took me some time, but i was able to train an agent with duelling double deep q-learning that has a win rate of about 45% within a few days of training in this video you can see the trained agent playing against iudex gundry you can also watch the video on &#x200b; *processing video rkor3hroj8xa1 * i'm also working on a visualisation that shows the agent's policy networks reacting to the current game input you can see a preview without the game simultaneously running here credit for the idea of visualisation goes to &#x200b; *processing video b0a4jzczv8xa1 * # but why? to be honest, i don't really know training to defeat a boss in a computer game does not advance the state of the art in any way, nor is it particularly useful so why do it? well, first of all because we can, and second because it maybe excites others about ml/rl/dl and most importantly because the road to achieving the goal is a ton of fun # final comments as you might guess, this project went through many iterations and it took a lot of effort to get it \\\"right\\\" i'm kind of proud to have achieved it in the end, and am happy to explain more about how things work if anyone is interested there is a lot that i haven't covered in this post it's really just the surface , but you can find more in the docs i linked or by writing me a pm also, i really have no idea how many people in ml are also active in the gaming community, but if you are a souls fan and you want to contribute by adding other souls games or bosses, feel free to reach out to me\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\nnull],\n [\"[d]: pytorch: differentiable norm\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\nnull],\n [\"[research] 16th european workshop on reinforcement learning\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\nnull],\n [\"[d] possibly corrupted weights : anyone who experienced this?

i recently built myself a bot that allows me to write and run commands, shell scripts, and even python from my phone very handy when you went to the bar and forgot to commit and push your code apple app is available [https://apps apple com/us/app/friendly-ai/id6447589849] the android app is currently in review so hopefully comes out later today if you are using mac/ubuntu the quickstart command from the github readme should set you up with a starter project if you either already have openai key on your system, or you create one and provide it on install, it will start you off with a simple chatgpt wrapper like the one that comes with the app if you sign up if you are on windows i\\u2019m sorry neither of us has one so we couldn\\u2019t create an install script however if you pip install the library and read the readme you should be fine furthermore because it\\u2019s self-hosted, you can be sure that your data stays private it\\u2019s stored on your own machine in mongodb if you have it setup, in json files if you don\\u2019t when you message your bots from the app the message data is sent directly to your bot and nowhere else i think here of all places people will make good use of this tech because personally since i don\\u2019t have millions of dollars and can\\u2019t be actually working on proper llm research by myself which is what i\\u2019d rather be doing tbh , at least i can build cool stuff that uses the already existing models the signup stuff isn\\u2019t necessary, the only reason why we built it is just to be able to limit people\\u2019s use of our bots, while also providing some access to them since without any bots you can\\u2019t try out the app but we want people to build their own bots, and not simply use ours! my hope was that it would remove a lot of the annoying parts of building bots and let people including myself concentrate on the actual interesting / ml /etc parts of the problem \\u2014 namely what the bot actually does in response to user prompts! and of course, the response doesn't actually have to use any llms e g you can hook up your local stable diffusion model , or ml in general as i said earlier i made a bot that simply executes the shell commands i give it ps our servers are basically free-tier so in the off-chance that there\\u2019s a lot of downloads they might not hold up but even if our servers are completely down that affects only our bots, you can still talk with your own bots!\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\n\"Project\"],\n [\"[d] has anyone tried finetuner for ner?

updates in the future since it will be a gradual growth process over time **prompt: i'd never heard of incremental learning before can you elaborate on it?** chatgpt: certainly! incremental learning, also known as online learning or continual learning, is a machine learning technique that involves updating a model's parameters and weights on a continual basis as new data becomes available this is in contrast to traditional batch learning, where a model is trained on a fixed dataset and then applied to new data without further updates in the context of language models like myself, incremental learning can be used to improve my performance over time by incorporating new text data and user interactions into my training corpus this allows me to continually adapt to new language patterns and improve my accuracy and fluency in a way that would not be possible through batch learning alone one of the challenges of incremental learning is managing the tradeoff between incorporating new information into the model and avoiding overfitting or catastrophic forgetting of previously learned information this requires careful balancing of model parameters and training strategies to ensure that the model continues to improve without becoming overly specialized or biased towards new data overall, incremental learning is an exciting and rapidly evolving area of research in machine learning, and has the potential to unlock new capabilities and insights for ai language models and other types of machine learning systems **prompt: what is catastrophic forgetting?** chatgpt: catastrophic forgetting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model, such as a neural network, forgets previously learned information when it is trained on new data this can happen because the model is not able to distinguish which information is important to retain and which can be safely discarded, leading it to overwrite old information with new data during the training process catastrophic forgetting can be a serious problem in incremental learning, where models are trained on new data over time in order to adapt to changing environments or tasks if a model is not designed to handle incremental updates properly, it may gradually forget important information from previous updates as it is exposed to new data, leading to a decline in performance over time there are various techniques that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting, including regularization techniques, rehearsal methods, and dynamic architectures these approaches aim to balance the tradeoff between incorporating new information into the model and preserving previously learned knowledge, and have shown promising results in improving the stability and

125m , and significantly cheaper than chatgpt right now chatgpt is $0 002 per 1k tokens, and it seems like the smaller models are about the same price for example, in gooseai the 1 3b is $0 000003 per token which is actually $0 003 per 1k which is even more than chatgpt in practice it will be less because of the way they calculate tokens, but for many use cases it will be not too much cheaper than chatgpt gooseai also has another unrelated issue where any time you have two newlines in a row, the model behaves as if it's starting a completely new text they never responded to my requests to fix this bug other services use a gpu-hours model which is much more expensive for example, at $1 per gpu hour it will cost over $700/month to maintain a 24/7 service so i need the service to charge by

management software for a team that currently has no data infrastructure hi all i'm a data analyst on a non technical team that collects and utilizes a lot of data because it's a non technical team there is essentially no data infrastructure set up specifically there is no data storage or management software being used we simply access our data directly in the file system the scope of our work has grown a lot recently and this way of doing things is quickly becoming unmanageable especially with respect to logging versioning and being able to find and reproduce old analyses so i'm wondering if it's time we use some actual software to help us with this i've been reading about data lakes our data is whole files can't be put into a relational database data warehouse i'm wondering if a data lake might help us however i've read that data lakes don't have any inherent structure to them and this is what allows them to store any type of data so what's the benefit of using data lake software services over just organizing our file system storage if i use a data lake will i still end up with the same question of how do i organize all this is there another type of software that i should be looking at that's more attuned to my needs keep in mind this is a non technical team so i will need to train any newcomer on whatever i use and can't assume they will have ds cs knowledge but they will likely be comfortable with simple scripting in python r bash etc thank you for any help\",\n\"datascience\",\n\"Discussion\"],\n [{\n            'v': 13,\n            'f': \"13\",\n

that claims it will prepare you for a job which i am doubtful of i also got a certificate for learning the command line bash scripting and did a few other introductory courses for things like web

practice and o\\u2019reilly textbooks i plan on learning sql and i\\u2019m learning the basics of cpp currently but i might switch to something else that\\u2019s more relevant to data science possibly

started only about a month ago with very minimal previous programming knowledge only a very basic understanding of javascript from khan academy lessons when i was #num# #num# and a visual basic class

put in about #num# #num# hours a day every day since and plan on continuing to do so i created a linkedin profile and took the skill assessment tests for python and and machine learning and scored in the top #num# % on both which felt good once i complete my current goals i want to do something more intensive so i can actually land a job in data science or something similar if it\\u2019s absolutely necessary i can get a traditional degree but i have also been looking into things like the lambda school data science bootcamp or ibm\\u2019s data science professional certification course i\\u2019d like some advice is there anything i should be doing that i haven\\u2019t mentioned or anything that i should be doing instead are my goals achievable\\u2014 or am i being unrealistic how

managed to extract every mention of references because all our documents follow naming standards for example abc#num# ab #num# #num# ab #num# etc the problem i am facing is that often a text won't just reference another document but will instead say that it is being referenced by another document for example here are #num# possible sentences for further detail go see ab #num# #num# or this document is used as a reference by ab #num# since these sentences don't necessarily follow a pattern i'd like to use a simple text classification model to detect whether a sentence is referencing to another document or is the subject of a reference i was inspired by an article on towardsdatascience for sarcasm detection but i can't find a pre exisiting data set for my problem do i have to train a

and scalable ml research experimentation with a list of best practices hello all i've been looking for a way to make my research more efficient and scalable after iterating over a couple of different frameworks and structures i converged on the following template #link# to get you a feel of how it might be useful for you take a look at #link# section of the readme it's based on pytorch lightning with hydra and its plugins i developed it for my research team but i also meant it as a starting point for anyone who would like to learn about this technology stack i find this combination simple to use but very powerful at the same time i believe it's very convenient for small team research reproducing papers implementing benchmarks and baselines and generally for projects in which you need to maintain many curated configurations of your experiments why i think this is awesome it allows us to painlessly scale from small experiments into hiperparameter search on multi gpu or slurm computing clusters with frameworks like optuna or ax the hyperparameter optimization requires minimal setup you only need to declare config with hyperparameter ranges and hydra takes care of the whole iterating over jobs logic possibility to use most experiment tracking frameworks like neptune wandb mlflow or just csv files easy configuration management with command line superpowers no need for argparse thanks to hydra advanced training and debugging features from pytorch lightning e g gradient accumualation deepspeed integration etc encapsulating datasets into lightning datamodules gives us a very convenient way for understanding and reusing datasets across projects i feel like most ml people don't use those tools because they simply don't realize all the advantages especially hydra seems like a very useful addition to any deep learning project i focused on structuring the readme in a way which i hope will give you a quick overview my hope is it can help to spread the word about those frameworks in a broaded community it incorporates #link# and tricks i gathered over the last couple of months of playing around with it my typical workflow is the following #num# i write a lightningdatamodule i found it to be an intuitive way to encapsulate any dataset lightningdatamodule is a simple abstraction providing methods for data download split transforms and exposing dataloaders would love to see more researchers try out this concept even in projects which don't use pytorch lightning reading lightningdatamodule makes me immedietely see how the dataset is prepared while it seems like most data science projects throw around data logic across different parts of the pipeline making it hard to understand what's going on you can see example of such datamodule #link# #num# i write a lightningmodule this basically just encapsulates my pytorch model code #num# i add new experiment config specifying the paths to the lightningdatamodule and lightningmodule now the training can be launched with some experiment tracker attached like csv logger or tensorboard `python` #link# `experiment simple_mnist logger tensorboard` btw the structure is partly based on data science cookie cutter project template if you didn't hear about it i recommend you to check it out i found it to be a great source of useful concepts for project organization #link# i'd love to hear

in film post production and i have no prior deep learning coding experience but i wanted a gpu with a lot of memory to process high res imagery with an existing tensorflow based open source toolset that i could just about figure out how to use with my small amount of python experience i did secure a titan rtx off amazon at retail price but i decided to return it when i found out about the imminent release of the ampere cards because $#num# sounded a lot better than $#num# of course the #num# is going for around the same price as the #num# k rrp i paid for the rtx titan i was very naive at that exact moment about the fact that crypto mining was going to go back into full swing although i was warned by someone on this very sub i did expect eth proof of stake to cancel some of that out but we aren't there yet besides availability issues there was also the size of the #num# which nvidia seem to have intentionaly made huge so it can't fit in a typical deep learning rig or graphics workstation no problem i'll get a third party blower card if i can find one in stock whoops now nvidia killed them all alright now i'll look at one of those rinky dink third party rgb gamer cards that are sufficiently low profile i only need one card with #num# gb vram okay they are all sold out forever and if you can get one it may be as expensive as the previous titan so maybe it's best to get an a#num# or a#num# because tbh it seems they are more likely to go for rrp which makes them not a huge step up from the inflated #num# prices and they are better supported on linux imo i have just found out about the lhr cards though that will be shipping soon but also that there may not be a #num# lhr so it doesn't seem like supply will necessarily improve there is now a proprietary gui based toolset by the same developers which is now using pytorch as the back end but it's still recommended that #num# gb is where you really want to be at memory wise without needing to slice up the input images too much so this issue is not going anywhere i had managed to get a #num# super with #num# gb as an interim card which is really the bare minimum it's also comical how much those cards are going for now so i'm glad i snagged one of the last ones at best buy for $#num# rrp last year\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\n\"Discussion\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1914,\n            'f': \"1914\",\n
