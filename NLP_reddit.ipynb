background i have an associates degree in business administration had not really had much computer programming experience study before about a year ago and generally was starting from scratch i was working as a teller and part time as a waiter before i started the program a friend of mine had joined a computer programming bootcamp and was hired at j p morgan as a java programmer almost

lists with tooltips maybe a summary row icons colors basically presenting data in a way that people will like to pay for currently i decided to go with a django backend and a react frontend overall i have to admit i hate frontend dev almost as much as i hate webapps still i thought react was a reasonable choice for a great user experience with a modern toolset right now the frontends authenticate against the backends and fetches data using graphql instead of traditional rest which sounded like a great idea at the time but actually i feel like this was a terrible approach when fetching data there needs to be a ton of transformation and looping over arrays done in the frontend to bringt the pieces of fetched data together in a format suitable to render tables which in my opinion is a mess fiddling with arrays in js while there is a python backend at my fingertips that could use pandas to do it in the fraction of the time but that seems just how this works i also got fed up with react it provides a lot of great advantages but honestly i am not happy having tons of packages for simple stuff that might get compromised with incompatible versions and stuff down the road also i feel bad about the packages available to create those tables in general it just feels extremely inefficient and that\\u2019s coming from someone usually writhing python overall what i like beautiful frontend

that #num# will represent a historical landmark in our recent memory it instantly split into two pre pandemic and post pandemic and like any historical landmark #num# ushered in a great variety of seismic changes everything we knew about life went upside down our goals our ambitions and priorities our notions of work and good governance the state of science and public knowledge our relationship with the environment and so many other phenomena that we never heeded to in the \\u2018old normal\\u2019 and of course in the \\u2018new normal\\u2019 this political psychological and social upheaval has also had an impact on the economy consumer behavior has changed drastically as well the lockdown and the chaos perhaps shaping in us a new sensibility of consumption everything from our habits needs preferences to our buying patterns has been reshaped by the pandemic after scientists studying the novel coronavirus and its effects data scientists are probably the most interested in what is to come and businesses like any other enterprise in #num# will be eagerly waiting to cash in on what they will discover so what have they discovered less is more an economic disruption and uncertainty that rivalled #num# \\u2019s crisis and the fear of a sudden lockdown caused people to only consume what\\u2019s essential according to a study by #link# #num# % of the participants were worried about job security while #num# % were wary of the global economic impact the caution was reflected in their spending habits as they prioritized value instead of worth saving generously the newfound sensibility was also shaped by convenience and availability given the sudden imposition of nationwide lockdowns what\\u2019s further of note \\u2014 perhaps unsurprising \\u2014 is the type of essentials that we consumed such as canned food or soup let\\u2019s take a look #link# it is hard to say whether the new sensibility \\u2014 which is great for the environment though bad for businesses \\u2014 will be cemented perhaps consumers will take their spending up a notch as the market gradually recovers until then businesses can capitalize on the new habits to which consumers have taken the consumption of entertainment news social media music art and books surged we also observed a moderate rise in cooking and fitness clearly people had the sudden urge to make a change they wished to put the time to good use brands selling these goods have a great opportunity to take hold of their market online thrives unsurprisingly online markets thrived thanks to the lockdown online businesses absolutely soared here's what we shopped online #link# however data suggests that online markets would have soared in any case according to #link# reported that #num# % avoided leaving their homes while #num# % decided to socially distance themselves even from their closest friends and relatives fear contained us it also contained work with the same study highlighting that #num# % of the workforce worked from home either partially or wholly there simply was no reason to go out and why would there be shopping online is far more convenient and safer the warning is clear as day go offline and online or miss out on a mammoth chunk of customers for businesses already online capitalize on the surge with attractive discounts and offers and since most customers seem to be online it is also time to work on your social media skills social media is quite easily the number one communication channel to reach your customers it profoundly affects people\\u2019s perception of your brand their opinion of your values your identity it has the power to influence people in swathes leverage it in fact in #num# consumers are suspicious of brands that do not have an online presence it would seem bizarre that a business operates online but is not socially active besides we don\\u2019t see any downside to not having an online presence customers love identifying with their favorite brand\\u2019s values which are depicted via tweets pictures videos and now stories or reels also social media is arguably one of the best platforms to identify your ideal customer and target him or her with personalized ads and offers hail the era of customer experience if a term could define this era's business ethos it would be personalized customer experience according to a #link# more than #num# % of customers expect their favorite brands to anticipate their needs and desires it is no wonder that customer worshipping juggernauts such as amazon and netflix are so wildly successful what fuels their success is two things first raw customer data and second powerful #link# that yield algorithms that anticipate their preferences their operation mimics the snowball effect \\u2014 the more data they collect the more strengthened the algorithms and the more strengthened the algorithms the more customers they attract which results in more data collection and on it goes other aspects that constitute an outstanding customer experience are personalized ads timed ads personalized offers human like chatbots and other communication avenues that help retain customers there were also other drivers of change in consumer behavior besides convenience and availability which we already mentioned consumers also prioritized quality and hygiene these factors literally caused them to switch brands take a look #link# the key takeaway is to embrace data or perish and the pandemic has only confirmed our conviction the best strategy is a dynamic strategy a strategy that constantly evolves and such a strategy can only be made with data analytics which takes measurable inputs and yields actionable outputs businesses that paid attention to these changes quickly altered their short

open source feature store called feast the idea behind feast is that it helps you to operationalize your features meaning it helps you build training datasets from your offline features it helps you load features into an online store in a structured way and it provides low latency access to your features in production the original design of feast was heavy weight you needed to run a big stack on kubernetes with spark we\\u2019ve been chatting to a bunch of users and the one thing we kept hearing was that they saw value in feast for productionizing their data but it was too heavy weight to own so we\\u2019ve put a lot of energy towards really simplifying feast we\\u2019ve made it as easy as a pip install you can now run feast locally if you\\u2019re just getting started with development testing but you can also deploy it to cloud providers like gcp if you want something more scalable we\\u2019d love for you to download it and try it out in your own projects we\\u2019ve got a slack

so that one's blood can't carry as much oxygen created via combustion of fossil fuels nitrogen dioxide is one of the results of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion is one of the precursors for other harmful pollutants such as ozone and particulates and plays a role in the formation of acid rain it becomes nitric acid it's also generally correlated with exposure to other byproducts of road traffic many of which have been linked to respiratory illnesses and systemic inflammation which can lead to a whole host of other health issues ozone is a powerful oxidant which makes it so that it can cause damage to respiratory tissues it also attacks various polymers like rubber eventually causing it to crack it's formed primarily from photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides like no#num# and volatile organic compounds vocs high concentrations aren't limited to urban areas however and it can travel hundreds of miles downwind from the source finally sulfur dioxide formed largely by the combustion of fossil fuels with high levels of sulfur as well as volcanic activity it's a precursor to acid rain it becomes sulfuric acid sulfur dioxide is known to be at least mildly toxic and

project duration costs profit not some ensemble or super boosted model in my mind this role exists with the title of data scientist senior data analyst depending on the company which does not need to be bio related please correct me if i'm off to describe my timeline briefly #num# i entered grad school with the goal of getting my phd and becoming a medical science liaison communicates scientific findings and technical knowledge to other researchers mds etc #num# this became less attractive after talking to some msls existential crisis recommendation from a professor that i pick up useful skills started learning r programming exploratory data analysis shored up on inferential statistics etc and found that i really enjoyed the lot #num# research into the ds career and communication with many bio phd folks turned ds led me to believe that a bio phd is only relevant useful for obtaining at ds job if it is accompanied by a project that involves the application of advanced statistics or actual machine learning techniques to the project this is my opinion so far #num# i struggled with my advisor a to come up with a project that allowed me to develop those skills and work toward his lab goals #num# i began applying for jobs ds and data analyst da around this time my plight became known to other professors and one of them offered to be my new advisor advisor b and let me work on a heavy computational project in his lab additionally one of those jobs has progressed to a final round interview and i am fairly confident that i will be offered the position my question re stated is which of these opportunities will be better for me in the long run i have described each opportunity more in depth below if you would like more information other questions for professional data folks in the field what is your opinion of the usefulness of a phd that is not in cs statistics math ds when applied to a ds or senior da role what is your opinion of colleagues with bio phds whom you work with in the ds role @ bio phd people who now work ds what does the landscape look like has your phd benefitted you in any way i e useful domain knowledge stats ability to get an interview the way you are treated by colleagues increased decreased opportunities payment and benefits my current opinion i have not taken the webscrape linkedin or indeed for data related to all ds da jobs approach my research into these roles however suggests to me that an m s degree may be sufficient long term most roles ask for either a ph d or an m s x years of experience i think i may be better off taking an m s and getting years of actual experience in the field moreover if i need to do some self learning to cover machine learning concepts or whatever i will have more free time to do this with an industry position compared to my ph d work i'm leaning toward accepting the offer however i welcome any comments suggestions or insight you all have with the exception of the first bullet below to note i'm not interested in arguments that fit the sunk cost fallacy no one can get any time already spent back and the time spent is not worthless because of the experience and insight gained i'm #num# if that helps all my professors are in the know about these opportunities and steps have been taken to give me the ability to make either decision i do not know how long the dissertation project would take if i accepted that project nor do i know where they profs want to publish they do know that i am interested in leaving asap and seem amenable to that i think both opportunities are equally interesting and i'm trying to ignore the fact that the industry position comes with a pay increase and likely a better work life balance i'm trying to view it through the lens of which is better long term more information about both opportunities if you're interested the industry position is a data analyst role on their continuous improvement team this company is in a position where they are growing and doing well selling machinery and software to improve logistic methods for other companies that move products i e warehousing they are accumulating data but do not have the know how to best utilize it they are even lacking etl pipelines that pull data from different departments to a centralized data warehouse and then send that data to dashboards or reporting tools i e what i'd call low hanging fruit they also have not entirely determined what kpis to track or what they want to measure moving forward they have one person with the title master data specialist and i would work with this person potentially giving me someone who could mentor me in this role what i see is a great opportunity to direct how they organize and use their data to have input on what questions are being asked and the opportunity to say that i helped build up the data team within the continuous improvement group the dissertation project is a project where i will lead the analysis of data from a large multi omic study omics is basically an approach where tissue is taken from a sample put through a big scary bio machine and hundreds to thousands of x where x is proteins genes lipids metabolites are identified and quantified these quantities are comparable across disease groups the advisor and his collaborators have multiple tissue types from hundreds of samples categorized by disease group they have data for proteins lipids metabolites etc their idea broadly is to use a network analysis approach to analyze the covariance between these x and determine clusters of related x #link# outside of the

#link# i haven't finished the degree yet but i'm far enough into it that i can give an honest assessment for those interested in enrolling first the good stuff eastern university puts their students first the professors administrators and admissions staff at eu have it together when it comes to solving problems and interacting with students they usually respond to my emails within an hour and give helpful feedback eu is super military friendly i'm using the post #num# #num# gi bill to fund my studies if you have #num# % gi bill then you get a degree for free and pocket at least $#num# k in stipends even if you only have #num# % gi bill like i do you'll still net around $#num# k at eastern you only need to take one class at a time to qualify as a full time student so you can collect that $#num# month stipend while only enrolled in a single class they also offer a $#num# per credit discount for veterans and active duty personnel if you're using tuition assistance while serving the whole program will only cost you $#num# out of pocket which is an insanely good deal for a graduate degree everything is self directed no weekly modules if you burn the midnight oil you can finish an entire seven week course in just a week or two that's quite convenient if you're a full time working professional with an unpredictable schedule the professor's videos give a clear description on how to use programming languages i enrolled with zero programming experience but they hold your hand through the whole thing and explain in detail how it all works at a theoretical level i usually have the instructional videos open in one window and my python editor open in another so i can pause and play around with it it's an effective way to learn and there are a few drawbacks academically it's not super challenging for example all the assignments can be retaken until you get the grade you want also as an online program it's possible for an unscrupulous student to cheat their way through although i have no idea why someone would spend all this money on a degree to learn data science and then just coast through the program if you want to gain proficiency with python r statistics etc you'll have to practice writing code and crunching numbers on your own in addition to the class assignments they do however provide you with all the learning materials you need to gain proficiency the student account website isn't the most user friendly simply signing up for a new class is a drawn out cumbersome process that took me a while to figure out the learning management system they use brightspace isn't the most efficient either the bottom line i know this sounds cliche but you'll get out of this program what you put into it if you only do the bare minimum to pass each course you can pay all this money just to get a fancy diploma but lack the data science knowledge to succeed in the real world if you go the extra mile and take time to master the material on your own you'll have a strong enough foundation in data science to get into the industry gain experience and build a successful career in a lucrative field eu's program is a convenient and affordable option for working professionals who want to branch out into data science and have the motivation to work for it and now i'll answer a few frequently asked questions how much time per week would i need to put in as a student it varies depending on how much time you need to practice and how many classes you take each course is seven weeks long i've been taking one course per term while working full time as a civil engineer part time as a national guard officer and taking care of my #num# month old daughter and i still have had plenty of time to finish each class with a few weeks to spare if you plan ahead each week it's possible to balance this program with a full time job eastern university isn't as prestigious high ranking as for example ut austin or georgia tech how will employers judge a degree from eu i wouldn't worry too much about university rankings once you're in the industry and have experience no one cares where you got your degree you'll also find that many data scientists are completely self taught and have degrees in unrelated subjects some of them don't have degrees at all for example my brother attended a bottom tier open enrollment university and studied computer science for a few semesters before dropping out even though he never finished his degree he became proficient at writing code and now makes six figures as a software engineer all you have to do is get good enough at writing the code to pass a technical interview to make yourself marketable do i even need a degree for this career field isn't it possible to learn data science simply by watching youtube videos yes it is possible to learn data science on your own but the structure of a degree program makes it easier to keep a consistent study schedule it also gives you something palpable to list on a resume when you start applying for jobs as i've stated earlier many private sector tech companies are loose on degree requirements however government and military jobs stipulate certain degrees for their applicants i currently work for dod as an engineer and every time i apply for a new position within our department i have to submit my transcript along with it an ms in data science

my question i would like to quote a paper by ishawaran et al on random forests for survival analysis data in which the authors very concisely outline the difficulties of feature selection i e which variables to include in a statistical model in classical regression models and how this problem is somewhat alleviated with more advanced models further because these methods i e classical regression models e g cox ph regression even though it's semi parametric are often parametric nonlinear effects of variables must be modeled by transformations or expanding the design matrix to include specialized basis functions often ad hoc approaches such as stepwise regression are used to determine if nonlinear effects exist identifying interactions especially those involving multiple variables is also problematic this must be done by brute force examining all two way and threeway interactions e g or must rely on subjective knowledge to narrow the search in contrast these difficulties are handled automatically using forests we illustrate the ease with which rsf can uncover complex data structures through an in depth case study of the prognostic implications of being underweight overweight or obese and having severe but stable coronary artery disease investigators have noted complex patterns surrounding possible reverse causation in underweight individuals interactions with smoking and an unclear inflection point at which point increasing body mass confers increased risk some have identified a possible obesity paradox among patients with established heart disease in which increased body mass predicts better survival to clarify these issues we analyzed a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery using rsf random survival forest we identified a complex relationship between long term survival body mass renal kidney function smoking and number of internal coronary artery bypass grafts we believe our novel findings help explain some of the apparent contradictions previously reported source https arxiv org pdf #num# pdf essentially the authors claim that traditional regression models struggle with feature selection and the newer models e g bagging random forest are able to better deal with feature selection i do remember from an intro stats class the somewhat tedious process of determining which variables to include in a multiple linear regression model as the authors described i remember there was something called cp mallow's criteria in which potential variables were repeatedly included and excluded in the regression model and the value of cp mallow's criteria was monitored a final selection of variables for the model was decided on the basis of this criteria however this selection process becomes inefficient for large datasets if i understand correctly this means you would have to refit the model for many different combinations of variables resulting in a combinatorics explosion for a large number of variables like the authors mention you can also manually hard code interaction terms in the model e g log var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# var#num# etc and there an infinite such number of potential interactions improper feature selection can also result in unwanted effects such as multicollinearity the last point i would like to bring up although my knowledge of mathematics is not strong enough to fully substantiate it is that classical regression models are said to have a tendency to overfit i don't know why i have seen visual demonstrations of this but i don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this or if it's just an empirical observation and poorly generalize to new data again i don't know why and that classical regression models are only able to recognize linearly separable patterns in the data intuitively i can understand this e g draw a circle of red points and a smaller circle of blue points that fits in the red circle a single line can not separate the two colors but i don't know if there is a mathematical explanation behind this this brings me to my question about feature selection for large datasets with the advent of technology data is becoming bigger and bigger everyday convolution neural networks are the go to method for analyzing pictures a standard black and white picture is said to have #num# variables whereas dna is said to have even more in such instances it surely must be impossible to address feature selection as done in conventional statistical modelling please excuse my poor understanding of math but my understanding is that newer statistical models have built in methods of handling the feature selection problem for instance random forest randomly chooses different combinations of variables and sees which combinations result in better model performance the exact randomizing mechanism uncorrelated trees is said to also prevent against multicollinearity i ahve heard that the creator of the random forest algorithm leo breiman claims through theoretical statistics that random forest by definition can not over fit and has some desirable error bounds and convergence properties is this true meanwhile i have read on data science blogs i'm not going to lie that deep neural networks are able to automatically learn and consider useful combinations of features for approximating the target function am i correct all in all what i want to ask here for large datasets where sometimes the features don't have any immediate meanings e g a patient's blood pressure vs the information contained in the #num# st pixel of a photograph is there any real way to handle feature selection or is this usually taken care of by the statistical model itself e g random forest and neural networks i have seen examples online where people attempted to write a massive for loop in which they train the same model with thousands of variable

for each component in the cnn architecture i\\u2019m trying to arrive at an intuitive semantic plain english understanding of what it does i do this by asking \\u201cwhat question does this component try to answer about its input \\u201d or if the question answer analogy doesn\\u2019t apply then \\u201cwhat does this component do to its input and why \\u201d where the answer doesn't merely describe the mathematical operations e g it's just a dot product for example pooling layers answer the question \\u201cwhich feature is most salient \\u201d returning the answer similarly dropout layers \\u201cforce the neurons in the following layer to learn independently of each other \\u201d etc armed with this high level interpretation intuiting the mathematics then becomes much easier okay filters well the cnn component du jour is the convolutional filter and i\\u2019m really struggling to articulate this kind of intuition about it in other words you pass a single region of the input into the filter convolve it and out pops a single number but i really don\\u2019t understand what that number represents in general terms of course i understand that the number is the \\u201csum of the element wise products\\u201d between the input and filter matrices but that description provides no intuitive semantic understanding it doesn\\u2019t tell me what the number represents without such an understanding these filters are basically just voodoo magic now i do have a theory and it\\u2019s based on the surprising but apparently true claim that despite their name these so called convolutional filters aren\\u2019t actually doing convolution at all but rather cross correlation using that fact as a starting point here\\u2019s my theory is the number output by the filter some quantification of the degree to which the input matrix is similar to or correlated with the filter matrix for a given region of the input given that these filters are sometimes called \\u201cfeature detectors\\u201d it seems like that would make a lot of sense and here's why i think that the filter represents some pattern and if the input resembles that pattern the filter will be stimulated and output a relatively larger value indicating the strength with which said pattern is present in the input in other words the greater the similarity correlation larger the output output and the more

been rather interesting to say the least back in december i ended up applying to do an applied data science course at various uk universities and rotman university of toronto as of thus i have only heard back from rotman and got accepted a few weeks ago it's their management analytics course last minute however i also decided to apply to rice university the reason i chose rice is mostly two fold first of all it's a school that i've heard really good things about secondly i have some friends in the texas area that i met online which i want to see if we can get a start up going it's important to note that i am a european citizen italian but i grew up most of my life as a tck third culture kid in asia hence i went to american schools my whole life and picked up much of that culture and accent with their extremely selectivity i assumed that i never even stood a chance at rice so when i got into rotman i basically set my heart on it and moved on with my life last night however i got accepted into their mds professional master's in data science course which will come out as being very similar to that of rotmans if not a bit more technical coming from an engineering background that's actually a plus as of right now i'm struggling on making my mind up on where to go toronto is technically speaking higher ranked than rice across the board however there's something about the name that seems as if when i talk to people they rank rice higher than uoft in their minds let me know if that's just my social bubble so in terms of status my brain says uoft is better but rice worst case scenario isn't a university to turn your head to with that it leads me on to why i care about status in the first place at the end of the day i couldn't care less personally i believe in the better experience and rice is currently just tipping the balances in foresight however employers and future mba programs for example may care very much about this it's important to note that i aim to graduate after #num# months and find work in the country i graduate from in the states i'll have #num# years of guaranteed work and #num# attempts at the h#num# b visa while in canada if i have an

could always just apply for a work visa in canada after graduating from rice right in general this is the gist of things i know that i've loved living in both places albeit i'd probably prefer the

finally i have two values for product because they can sell one of two products i was having a lot of trouble however with one thing since the data is unpivoted and we have data for numerous steps in the sales process there is no real easy way to filter out rows where sales is in a early step in the sales process and has no associated value for the later stages since the id column has repeating values if you just filter out the later steps in the process step column the data won't reflect properly because sales might actually be in that later stage or even closed out the sale but just filtering it out doesn't actually do anything other than hide the later stage rows how did i solve the issue i created a reference table a copy of the original table and added custom columns with if statements if process step is approved then #num# else for blank i did this five times for every process step and now i have five columns with #num# and #num# values from there i used these five

supervision and working conditions when you look back at the best moments of your career they won\\u2019t really include the perks or the free lunches you got instead you\\u2019ll look back and

is burning under my fingernails i am currently working in a market and social research institute for a little over two years which would like to gradually finally dedicate itself to more modern solutions to deliver results before that you could find me as a market researcher in financial consulting trying to slay the spreadsheet headed hydra with python but i'd rather tell that story another day anyway if you know market research you will also know the typical researcher type of guy who still throws around piles of crosstabs and powerpoint slides and prefers to create their postscript tables based on fixed column ascii data as our company still does in parts but this industry does not sleep either and so interactive reporting formats are gradually gaining acceptance now here comes the difficulty what solution can be found to create dashboards for external customers in ad hoc study projects without much infrastructural effort it needs an environment that i can give to less code savvy people if they want to set up at least rudimentary reporting that nevertheless offers a minimum of interaction the big difficulty here is that many solutions i find on the market typically handle metric data very well but in market research there is also a lot of categorical and ordinal scaled data generated by multiple choice and matrix questions where i need for example stacked column charts of #num# matrix items with their corresponding likert scales sorted by top #num# values from the respective scale which i also need to function after drill down filtering and as reproducible as possible open source solutions are preferred in our company tableau powerbi and relatives are less attractive due to licensing costs around the corner i'd also thrown tools like metabase on a server hooked it up to a few sample databases and tried it but the internal query capabilities were too limited for the multi variable graphs i just mentioned it worked but ate up too much time for one graph prorietary tools like dapresy and displayr can inherently work very well with such data as they can even handle wide format input which of course makes importing data easier but again there are licensing costs that quickly scale along with the projects at the moment i'm thinking about covering this use case with r flexdashboards and giving my colleagues a library that provides typical functions for us so that we can at least generate a viable product but i refuse to believe that there isn't a more scalable solution around i would be very happy to hear of any good solutions

strong interest in computer science and programming i took an introductory class in computer science java based and loved it and did pretty well i also realized just how useful even a basic

continue improving my data analysis skills by taking linear algebra and a class called mathematics for numerical computation and machine learning which has mostly focused on topics in linear algebra and probability relevant to machine learning i e eigen stuff singular value decomposition different probability distributions etc all of the assignments for the latter class have been in python which i am loving so far and have been using for the aforementioned curve fitting analysis in my research so my question is for someone with a basic to intermediate understanding of programming and computer

likely to respond so given this information how can i replace these missing data for instance if i model the missing data using the demographic variables age sex income i mentioned e g train a

analyst on a non technical team that collects and utilizes a lot of data because it's a non technical team there is essentially no data infrastructure set up specifically there is no data storage or management software being used we simply access our data directly in the file system the scope of our work has grown a lot recently and this way of doing things is quickly becoming unmanageable especially with respect to logging versioning and being able to find and reproduce old analyses so i'm wondering if it's time we use some actual software to help us with this i've been reading about data lakes our data is whole files can't be put into a relational database data warehouse i'm wondering if a data lake might help us however i've read that data lakes don't have any inherent structure to them and this is what allows them to store any type of data so what's the benefit of using data lake software services over just organizing our file system storage if i use a data lake will i still end up with the same question of how do i organize all this is there another type of software that i should be looking at that's more attuned to my needs keep in mind this is a non technical team so i

met \\u201d it\\u2019s like where are these guys learning this stuff \\u201d #link# characteristics of imposter syndrome some of the common signs of imposter syndrome include #link# self doubt an inability to realistically assess your competence and skills attributing your success to external factors berating your performance fear that you won\\u2019t live up to expectations overachieving sabotaging your own success setting incredibly challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short what is imposter syndrome #link# imposter syndrome is loosely defined as doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud it disproportionately affects high achieving people who find it difficult to accept their accomplishments many data scientists question whether they are deserving of accolades their job recognition or the like you do not have enough time to learn something you want to learn you look around and see that there are other people that know that thing you don\\u2019t have time to learn you feel incompetent why do so many data scientists have it data science is an extremely broad field of study there are core competencies required to have a successful career in data science but there is also a lot of industry specific and technical knowledge that is ever changing data science is a career which has many job options all of which require a high level of expertise and knowledge if the broad seemingly confused data science job postings show us anything it is that many companies do not really understand what a data scientist is how they compare to a data engineer or software engineer and how to train or support them within an organization to add to this the labor market for data scientists in predominantly new graduated or early career professionals when challenge is high and expectations are unknown it encourages people to fall into high arousal anxiety and worry you can see this from psychologist\\u2019s #link# flow model these feelings are compounded by a lack of support feedback and mentorship provided within a company this is not generally intentional but a product of small data science departments business executives licking their wounds from years of poor data quality and technical deficit and increasing demand for better data driven outcomes how can data scientists deal with imposter syndrome #link# if you recognize yourself in the description of the impostor phenomenon take heart there are ways to overcome the belief that you don\\u2019t measure up in a nutshell there are three ideas that you need to get in your head in order to get over imposter syndrome you are a generally competent person there are always going to be people that know more about a certain area of data science than you and that\\u2019s ok and expected even more importantly you\\u2019re not the smartest person in the planet so if you look hard enough you\\u2019re going to find people that are better than you at everything you do and that\\u2019s ok you have a finite amount of time to learn things and your goal shouldn\\u2019t be to learn the most but to learn the things that maximize your specific goals \\u2013 generally this is going to be career advancement but for some it may be something else when the imposter syndrome feeling comes up #num# remind yourself that you are a competent person \\u2013 if you weren\\u2019t you wouldn\\u2019t have gotten to the position you are in right now whether that\\u2019s graduating from college or leading a data science team yes even ds team leaders catch the \\u2018drome from time to time #num# remind yourself that when you look for people who know more than you about a specific area you are guaranteed to find them \\u2013 that\\u2019s just how it works people choose to specialize in certain areas and if you only focus on that area of expertise you are going to feel inadequate but even more importantly recognize that if you run into someone who is better than you at literally everything you do that doesn\\u2019t diminish your value \\u2013 it just means you have run into someone that is pretty special #num# get back to prioritizing what to learn do you need to learn that or do you just want to learn it to feel better about yourself if the latter learn to let it go and focus on the things you need to learn \\u2013 and save the things you want to learn for when you have the time which will come #link# #link# talk to your mentors \\u201cthe thing that made so much of a difference was supportive encouraging supervision\\u201d many have benefited from sharing their feelings with a mentor who helped them recognize that their impostor feelings are both normal and irrational though many will often struggle with these feelings you must be able to recognize personal or professional progress and growth instead of comparing myself to other students and professionals recognize your expertise don\\u2019t just look to those who are more experienced more popular or more successful for help tutoring or working with younger students for instance can help you realize how far you\\u2019ve come and how much knowledge you have to impart this can be a great way for a data scientist to give back to the industry as well as set a more realistic benchmark of your perceived value remember what you do well psychologists suzanne imes phd and pauline rose clance phd in the #num# s impostor phenomenon occurs among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success imes encourages her clients to make a realistic assessment of their abilities \\u201cmost high achievers are pretty smart people and many really smart people wish they were geniuses but most of us aren\\u2019t \\u201d she says \\u201cwe have areas where we\\u2019re quite smart and areas where we\\u2019re not so smart \\u201d she suggests writing down the things you\\u2019re truly good at and the areas that might need work that can help you recognize

helpful a psychologist or other therapist can give you tools to help you break the cycle of impostor thinking the impostor phenomenon is still an experience that tends to fly under the radar often the

breaking point of frustration a week ago when i engaged with a recruiter at one of these companies and i was sent a link to several medium articles to prepare for the interview including one with a line so tone deaf not to be coming from the author of the article but to be coming from the recruiter that it left me speechless as i describe my own experience i can\\u2019t help thinking of a common misconception i often hear it\\u2019s not possible to gain the knowledge on product experimentation without real experience i firmly disagree i did not have any prior experience in product or a b testing but i believed that those skills could be gained by reading listening thinking and summarizing i'll stop here for a second beacause i know i'm going to get flooded hate i agree you can #num# % acquire enough knowledge about a topic to pass know enough to pass a screening however there is always a gap between knowing something on paper and in practice and in fact that is exactly the gap that you're trying to quantify during an interview process and this is the core of my issue with interview processes of this kind if the interview process is one that a person can prepare for then what you are evaluating people on isn't their ability to the job you're just evaluating them on their ability to prepare for your interview process and no matter how strong you think the interview process is as a proxy for that person's ability to do the actual job the more efficiently someone can prepare for the interview the weaker that proxy becomes to give an analogy i could probably get an average #num# year old to pass a calculus test without them ever actually understanding calculus if someone told me in advance what were the #num# most likely questions to be asked if i know the test is going to require taking the derivative of #num# functions and i knew what were the #num# most common functions i can probably get someone to get #num# out of #num# questions right and pass with a c it's actually one of the things that instructors in math courses always try and it's not easy to accomplish giving questions that are not foreign enough to completely trip up a student while simultaneously different enough to not be solvable through sheer memorization as others have mentioned in the past part of what is challenging about designing interview processes is controlling for the fact that most people are bad at interviewing the more scripted structured rigid the interview process is the easier it is to ensure that interviewers can execute the process correctly and unbiasedly the problem the trade off is that in doing so you are potentially developing a really bad process that is you may be sacrificing accuracy for precision is there a magical answer probably not the answer is probably to invest more time and resources in ensuring that interviewers can be equal parts unpredictable in the nature of their questions and predictable in how they execute and evaluate said questions but i think it is very much needed to start talking about how this process is likely broken and that the quality of hires that these companies are making is much more driven by their brand

to data science i'm currently working in the accounting department note not a cpa or anything close to that of a non profit and i'm considering switching over to data science i've recently admitted to myself that accounting just isn't right for me and that i've stuck with my job mostly because i like what my company does by switching over to data science though i still do hope to eventually work in either the non profit or government sector although maybe not necessarily right after i make this switch i think that it would be great i do work that examines data to assess the effectiveness of things such as basic income programs or possibly other kinds of social intervention programs that said i need advice on how to make this switch i'm mainly wondering if i should do grad school or a data science boot camp and need help weighing the pros and cons and picking the right program i've only recently started looking into this so i'll admit that i don't have a long list but so far here are the pros and cons i see grad school pros name recognition higher quality education at least at the more reputable programs provides a decent amount of theory to build off of that in the long run could contribute to skill development cons costly time consuming #num# #num# years for full time programs #num# years for part time programs according to my preliminary research academic rigor could be difficult for someone without any kind of stem background possibly requiring a lot of self studying or bridge courses early on cost might require me doing a part time program and continue my current job but the academic rigor for it could make it difficult to balance with work boot camp pros more affordable less time consuming most programs seem to be anywhere between #num# #num# months this is rather appealing as i actually would like to leave my current job right away if possible and if i were to do this full time i'd feel the hit of having no income for a much shorter period of time than with grad school at least some boot camps have a job guaranty program attached to it although not #num# % sure how reliable those are cons difficult to assess which boot camp is better than which lower quality training than even undergrad programs a friend of mine used to work as a tech recruiter and her company's policy for programming jobs was to not even consider those who only did boot camps because they just weren't at the same level as those who studied cs in college because of point mentioned above even if i land a job after boot camp career growth might be limited alternative i've ruled out boot strapping i know that online platforms like coursera and edx are great starting points but they're just that a starting point i don't trust myself to have the discipline to just learn from there and find a bunch of projects to develop my skills so i definitely want some kind of structured curriculum that's supposed to get me ready for a career alternative i'm considering boot camp then grad school considering some of the cons of boot camps they might not be great for the long term however i'm wondering if they do help me get a relatively high paying job and i get some years of experience under my belt then would going to grad school be helpful in furthering my career i might have a leg up when i apply to school because of the work experience and while i might need still need help with the math and theoretical aspects of the curriculum i'd hopefully have a relatively easy time with coursework dealing with more applied aspects this turned out

my general idea is that each day should basically be viewed as a batch models should be learning from relative rankings within a day but not between days because there is no guarantee the first article from one day is more relevant than the third article from the next day just training globally on rankings think multi class where the response classes are rankings would not preserve this fact

which uses nns plus one of their #link# #num# how does lgbm approach groups i've tried reading through the original #link# but still can't totally wrap my head around it is is like what i said where groups queries are all treated independently and no assumptions are made about relative rankings between groups queries thus far i've gotten pretty poor performance out of of lgbm ranking model but admittedly i'm using bag of words i could try and feed embeddings into the model but it seems tensorflow ranking is better at that which leads to my second question #num# can you use tensorflow ranking without contextual information in theory i can feed each date in as a context i suppose such as by making dates unique ids or categoricals but will tfr then make a bunch of mini models specific to each date and not a good global model obviously i don't really care about which article is specifically relevant for october #num# #num# because i will never again be getting articles for that day will tfr be able to learn that the context information i'm feeding in is useless concretely i imagine the model learning that the weights for the contextual input should be zero but i don't know in practice if this is the case i know what i'm asking is a bit contradictory i want to train only on relative rankings inside a group which i'm not sure lgbm satisfies yet i'm aiming for a single global model that doesn't actually depend on the group which i'm not sure tfr satisfies obviously a bit of this can be resolved by empirically testing performance but i figured having a better

did not match the positions i was applying for a difficulty i faced petty regularly in the field soon rejections started pouring in this didn't perturb me at all i got an internship opportunity and applied to the usa for phd positions of my liking i completed my internship and received a reco for a school in brazil but all was not to be i soon had a falling out with the professor who refused to recommend me at the last moment i had already invested a lot so i went ahead with my phd applications and decided to take recommendations from other professors it was heartwarming to see that so many people friends family and teachers were willing to stand up for me i was confident in my application as i did my work under some of the top professors in their field i simultaneously started preparing myself for a phd coursework but by mid march i received no email from the grad schools it got me worried but also funnily jubilant i soon concluded that i must find something which i would enjoy

figma but there is no home for sql adhoc queries don't belong in github and analyses are most often adhoc and not put into production it is not easy to share the sql you've written to co workers to troubleshoot a problem together arrive at conclusions or to generally share findings it is also not possible to share documentation around the sql you've written and oftentimes you want to join business context the purpose of this metric as it pertains to the marketing team or a particular project with the query itself this is not possible within the current ide landscape think datagrip

what is the lineage diagram for this table what are popular tables pertaining to this keyword has another person done this analysis before i want this context on the same page as the sql that i'm writing prequel solves these three problems as follows #num# data discovery and context engine prequel automatically aggregates metadata schema lineage query logs audit logs directly from your data warehouse it also automatically creates backlinks between the data tables columns to the queries that everyone has written in your organization #num# query docs querydocs i've invented a new pattern called the querydoc that is very similar to the notion pattern embeddable and runnable sql this way you can take rich notes as you write your sql and you are able to hierarchically organize your

if linear models are too rigid to capture non linear patterns but what about the opposite suppose you take the same example with the #num# variables #num# predictors and #num# response this time you have new data and make a plot and the data appears to have a strong linear patterns in this example if you had still chosen to use a non linear model has their been any mathematical research that examines the ability of a non linear model to capture linear patterns in this example would a linear model have some advantage at recognizing and capturing linear patterns compared to a non linear model or in general are linear patterns completely within the domain of non linear patterns and as such non linear models are not expected to have any disadvantages at recognizing linear patterns

are related to experimental design note the author brings up a point here that i am not sure why this is true conversely in the two class case although few real data sets have exactly linear decision surfaces it is common to find that the centroids of the predictor variable distributions of the classes are different so that a simple linear surface can do surprisingly well as an estimate of the

were the thoughts i had after reading this paper this was paper was published in #num# before the deep learning revolution e g in #num# when convolution neural networks clearly outperformed humans at

and edges are only of one type in what circumstances would it make more sense to perform classical community detection algorithms on this graph e g louvain vs considering a stochastic block model i was slightly confused by the idea of recovery in the context of stochastic block models recovery refers to the ability of the model to recover all true communities with high probability if we don't

and you need to develop a model that will then be used to make billions of predictions and it's intractable to develop your model i e run experiments tune hyperparameters compare models on all data because it's too expensive how would you approach developing a model i'm curious if people have principled ways of approaching these kinds of settings mine would be take a stratified random sample of the data the stratification should respect the distribution of target labels and any features you consider important the sample should be small enough so that you can feasibly tune the hyperparameters of models you consider and use cross validation rather than simple train test splits once you've gone through iterations of feature engineering model comparison analysis and identified your best candidate model re train on a larger dataset to plot the learning curve and see how important additional data is depending on how much your model benefits from additional data re train on as large a dataset as possible and use that model in production in terms of tools libraries i'd imagine the stratified sampling would be done using spark the model development with libraries like scikit learn and pytorch i realize there are ml frameworks such as sparkml that allow you train models on spark but i feel like they aren't nearly fleshed out enough to support the iterative workflow described above however since these libraries are a lot more efficient you could train on a lot more data thoughts on the tradeoff between more iterations on smaller data vs fewer iterations on more data and

follows is too naive but this afternoon i had this idea after watching this talk about transformers #link# to finish with the background i'll add that i know that google has a kind of universal machine translator but as far as i have tried it it is not very good so i guess that there is still room for improvent ok here is the idea it's a multi step process #num# train an encoder decoder english language model a kind of autoencoder that aims to reproduce a given sentence having a bottleneck in the middle for the encoder all sota nlp techniques could be applied like using word embeddings transformers and whatever but the inner representation in the latent space should not be sequential as the order of a sequence is very language dependent and not language agnostic the aim of this first model will be to build a universal latent space in which meaning is preserved but not language dependent properties of text so maybe applying some fully connected layers and or convolutions could do in order to mix the sequential information into an unordered representation in the latent space #num# if the first step is reasonable achieved the most inner part of this model could be used as a universal representation of language how could we project other language onto this space well my idea is to do it in three steps #num# let's suppose that we are dealing with spanish first we will nedd a corpus of translated sentences from english to spanish as complete and accurate as possible #num# second we will train a model with exactly the same architecture of the first half of the first one but random inizializated weights maybe word embeddings could be initialized but that's all with the first half i mean that it only will have the encoder part not the decoder if we label the sentences as e#num# s#num# e#num# s#num# em sm being ei the english sentence and si the spanish translation the aim of the model will be mapping si to the latent representation of ei as accurate as possible the loss function could be suited for this regression task like a mean square loss after this training is finished we will have an spanish encoder that project spanish sentences in the same latent space as the first model #num# third we will train the spanish decoder whose aim will be like in the first model to map the latent representation to actual spanish sentences with the minimum loss of meaning in this part of the training the first part of the model the encoder will have the weights fixed because this weights are adjusted to preserve the map i believe that

rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks a successful approach to ssl is to learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample however a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details we propose an objective function that naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible this causes the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors the method is called barlow twins owing to neuroscientist h barlow's redundancy reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks barlow twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network gradient stopping or a moving average on the weight updates it allows the use of very high dimensional output vectors barlow twins outperforms previous

coursework in the human computer interaction course i was taking thank you the first survey was an instance of needfinding which is where i investigate the users of an interface with an aim to find their demographics the things they are trying to do with the interface the context of these tasks and their impressions of the interface s they use to do a certain target task which in this case is scheduling a computing job on shared computing resources using slurm the following is copied from my paper there are a few takeaways that i can get from the survey results most respondents use a command line interface presumably the one that slurm provides and they are not satisfied and not unsatisfied with it most respondents use slurm fewer than #num# times per week which is expected because we expect computing jobs to have high enough complexity to be worth scheduling with slurm other insights might be compromised by bias as explained below i had intended to take certain steps to control for biases but i had not anticipated the limited time and responses that i would have to gather responses therefore some of the mechanisms that i had intended to use to reduce bias are not implemented one such mechanism was providing the survey in mandarin in addition to english i only provided it in english because i did not have time to verify a mandarin translation thus english literate users are overrepresented another mechanism was distributing the survey in different communities because i was limited to #num# responses i had to stop gathering responses before i could send it to communities other than students taking cs #num# at georgia tech and #link# on reddit which is frequented by machine learning researchers thus academic users and researchers are overrepresented i was able to implement mechanisms that were inherent to the survey design such as not showing questions before participants start the survey and asking questions so that they do not encourage certain responses over others i executed one other needfinding activity in which i observed #num# participants doing the target task giving them the option to explain their actions i also performed a heuristic evaluation of the slurm interface for doing the target task based on these activities i defined performance goals for proposed prototype interfaces a new interface should maintain functionality for the most common tasks that the users do which includes the target task as well as determining available partitions charge ids and hardware configurations that are available on the computing clusters criteria for evaluation is whether a user can perform those tasks at the same time it should be at least as accurate and efficient compared to the command line interface evaluation criteria are time and keystrokes or clicks it should require the same or less time or the same or fewer keystrokes or clicks to perform the same tasks and doing them predictably and reliably at the same time it should be more learnable such that a new user should be able to learn to use it from within the interface and perform at least the target task without script errors caused by forgetting key words or syntax the criterion for evaluation is whether a new user can do so in terms of accessibility if appropriate files are in place performing at least the target task must require only mouse clicks or finger taps with a keyboard required only for first time authentication the criterion for evaluation is whether a user can do so the interface must be compatible with client devices running linux and preferably also windows and macos the interface must be compatible with slurm servers running linux and comply with their terms of use the criterion for evaluation is whether it can be installed and used on linux connecting to a slurm server running linux the development of the interface must cost no more than #num# hours of development time for a single researcher who has limited experience in graphical user interface development at the time i was not sure whether i had to implement the interface upon learning that i did not i decreased the importance of cost i then proceeded to brainstorm #num# prototype interfaces i used my gut feeling to evaluate the anticipated performance of each idea in terms of functionality accuracy efficiency learnability accessibility compatibility compliance and cost weights were #num# #num# #num# #num# #num# #num# #num# #num# respectively the weight of cost is negative because lower is better i found the top three ideas were #num# a simple executable with a form #num# a dag for organizing jobs #num# a run configuration available in an ide the third one was presented in my second survey #link# was presented with the following text consider an interface that is an extension that can be installed on an integrated development environment ide that enables scheduling jobs in the same way that a user would run them locally through a run configuration the configuration settings panel shown in the figure above enables changing common settings and enforces a valid configuration upon clicking the run button the interface attempts to schedule the job #link# summarizes the responses i got from the survey because respondents need not perceive the intervals between response options to be constant i can't do any statistical tests but i can still eyeball the results to inform a subsequent round of needfinding the main takeaways are that the prototype might not meet efficiency requirements as expected the greatest advantages the proposed interface has over the command line interface which i determined users typically use seem to be that it is more accurate more learnable more memorable and that it fits better into users' workflows i was surprised that many respondents expected to perform the target task somewhat slower none expected to do it much more quickly and #num# expected to do it much more slowly an interpretation would be that many respondents are so experienced at using the command line interface that it would be difficult to outperform them changes that are suggested from the feedback are that the next iteration of this prototype if it will be subject to further development should try to increase efficiency however the demographic may find that the sacrifice in efficiency is worth the advantages in other areas i did not collect information about the relative importance of these aspects at this point the course assignments changed such that i had to investigate a different interface i've become very busy with work and since i won't be paid by anyone for continuing this investigation and because my grade is no longer being held hostage i'm going to just leave

different fields and backgrounds but none come close to the obnoxiousness pomposity and outright unpalatable know it all vibe from the machine learning community and i'm sure it's a case of a small rotten bunch smearing the whole field this behaviour is most rife in #num# places the cesspit known as twitter reddit and somewhat in industry it's much less rampant comparatively in academia in my experience and just so we're clear google brain deepmind fair is not academia here is some of what i've observed think they can dominate a field or little involvement from smes often i see in machine learning a group or groups will swarm on a problem throw ml at the data and call the problem solved very little if any sme involved and importantly no follow up the exceptions to this general are few and far between dl encourages a habit of not learning the basics i have encountered this so often and it is especially apparent in dl people will jump straight into e g cv or nlp and not bother learning anything foundational i've seen and spoken to numerous people publishing in cv papers in prestigious conferences who don't even know what why colour spaces are useful or even what a pixel is because it sure as fuck isn't a small square on an image you may claim that they don't need to know this but that delusional talk and they absolutely do there is a limit to what compute cnn transformer can do after that you need foundations to know how to improve no real work goes into the vast majority of papers more of a dl problem this has been cited by many in the past however i must articulate it myself i also understand that there are many contributing factors to this and indeed all the other problem it's most often slight architecture change or incremental improvement with no real thought gone into the paper what this sometimes results in i have seen numerous times myself in a variety of settings including my own teams is a phd being no good at engineering or less productive at research than an msc with experience under his belt the whole point of a phd coming into an ml team is to be useful at r d and that is not always the case as much as you'd expect insolence and arrogance of fairness ethics crowd this crowd as it currently operates simply serves as a cancerous tumour to the ml world there always point out problems but never real solutions they act like gatekeepers and god's gift to the world it brings about massive toxicity to the virtual ml community and prohibits free speech of the community without fear of repercussions the this crowd could do with an overhaul as its leaders are some of the most vitriolic yobos who claim to be academics for such an applied field very little focus on applications often the excuse put forward is that fields like math have very few applications straight away firstly ml is not like math it's more like straight up engineering especially dl it's primarily applied and should thus be much more focused on application your slight architecture change or you #num# % improvement on imagenet is not a pythagoreon theorem waiting to happen it's laziness and just wanting to get your phd surely if doing a phd you actually want to make a real contribution to the field that you can stand behind fields like physics and stats are often applied and make a real world impact with the applications to be fair

generate music using neural nets i started with a wgan using #num# d convs which produced not the best results i would really like to use an rnn to generate audio just like how you would generate text by sampling the output and feeding that sample back to the input on the next time step since the audio i am using is sampled at #num# hz this method is not practical so what i decided to do is first use an auto encoder with a gumbel softmax in between this way i could compress the audio data and learn a discrete encoding for it once i have this encoder i plan to train an rnn on the encoding just like you would on text then i can use the decoder to convert this into sound currently the best architecture i have is as follows the encoder compresses the audio down #num# x to a discrete representation with #num# different values hard gumbel softmax between encoder and expander the expander expands the discrete representation back out to the length of the original raw audio the decoder uses an rnn to predict the next sample based on the prior sample and input from the expander i tried a wavenet instead of rnn and so far the rnn produces a better result i care more about

meddoprof a shared task that we are currently organizing focused on the detection and normalization of professions and employment status in clinical texts in spanish even if these types of entities might seem really niche every day we learn more and more about their importance just think about how someone's occupation can have a radical impact in their physical and mental health habits lifestyle choices there is even an entire medical specialty occupational medicine that is centered around this topic in the context of the current pandemic many people with specific occupations have been specially affected for instance health professionals and other essential workers the detection of these terms will help researchers to better characterize health risks of specific occupations outside medicine we foresee that the systems resulting from meddoprof may be used in fields such as social care human resources legal nlp and even gender studies personally i think one of the main contributions of the task is the inclusion of employment status in a broad sense we have annotated unemployed and retired people family caregivers people who are homeless people who depend on government subsidies etc which strengthens the social side of this project additionally each mention in the corpus which includes #num# documents from over #num# different medical specialties has been

iterating over a couple of different frameworks and structures i converged on the following template #link# to get you a feel of how it might be useful for you take a look at #link# section of the readme it's based on pytorch lightning with hydra and its plugins i developed it for my research team but i also meant it as a starting point for anyone who would like to learn about this technology stack i find this combination simple to use but very powerful at the same time i believe it's very convenient for small team research reproducing papers implementing benchmarks and baselines and generally for projects in which you need to maintain many curated configurations of your experiments why i think this is awesome it allows us to painlessly scale from small experiments into hiperparameter search on multi gpu or slurm computing clusters with frameworks like optuna or ax the hyperparameter optimization requires minimal setup you only need to declare config with hyperparameter ranges and hydra takes care of the whole iterating over jobs logic possibility to use most experiment tracking frameworks like neptune wandb mlflow or just csv files easy configuration management with command line superpowers no need for argparse thanks to hydra advanced training and debugging features from pytorch lightning e g gradient accumualation deepspeed integration etc encapsulating datasets into lightning datamodules gives us a very convenient way for understanding and reusing datasets across projects i feel like most ml people don't use those tools because they simply don't realize all the advantages especially hydra seems like a very useful addition to any deep learning project i focused on structuring the readme in a way which i hope will give you a quick

improves performance generalization and sample efficiency fine tuning gpt #num# converges after only #link# this raises the question can very large nns be so sample efficient that they one shot learn in a single sdg updates and reach human level inference and generalization abilities and beyond then one could simply predict the next few seconds from the previous few seconds and continuously one shot learn these sensory transitions and have some output neurons drive some actuators and train them with policy gradient then long term and near term recall would simply be generalizations of one shot learned sensory transitions and similarly decision making would simply be generalization of one shot learned modulations to the policy to make clear what i mean by one shot learning by sdg and recall by generalization let's say you are about to have dinner and you predict it is going to be pasta but it's actually fish then the sdg update makes you one shot learn what you ate that evening due to the prediction error when asked what you ate the next day then by generalization from the context of yesterday to the context of the question you know it was fish further one could use each prediction sample as an additional prediction target such that the model one shot learns its own predictions as thoughts that have occurred and by generalization and reward modulation these thoughts become goal driven allowing the agent to ignore the prediction objective if it increases reward e g pondering via inner monologue instead of listening one would also need to feed the prediction sample as additional sensory input in each time step such that the model has access to these thoughts or predictions then conscious thoughts are not in a latent space but in sensory space this matches the human mind as we too cannot have thoughts beyond our model of the data generating process of sensory experience further conscious thoughts would occur in brief time slices which also matches human conscious thoughts skipping from one thought to the other in almost discrete manner with consciousness hence only existing briefly #link# and reality being re interpreted each second afresh tied together via one shot learned contextual information in the previous steps by allowing the model to learn from imagined predicted rewards too imitation learning would be a simple consequence of generalization namely by identifying the other agent with the self model that naturally emerges the mere self model of one's predictions thoughts being learned by predicting one's own predictions seems to be sufficient for thoughts to get strategically conditioned by previous thoughts such that they are goal directed again relying on generlization i e the model may be conditioned to do x by a one shot learned policy update but by world knowledge it knows x only works in context y which establishes a subgoal the model also knows that its thoughts act as predictors thus by generalization in order to achieve x it generates a thought that the model expects to be completed in a manner that is useful to get to y the architectural details may not matter much ignoring economic factors there is not a large difference between different nn architectures so far even though transformers #link# there is no strong divergence i e no evidence of lstms not being able achieve the same performance with

uncertainty calibrated scores so i've been working on an activation function that could work as a drop in replacement for softmax with the main original intention to be to apply the principle of

convert between correlation scores #num# to #num# and probabilities #num# to #num# the idea is that certainty can be measured such that #num# certain #num# fully unknown and #num# certainly not and that there is a way to convert between this and #num# to #num# probabilities by setting #num# on the correlation scale to #num# n on the probability scale how this is relevant to a neural net is that in some sense a pre activation signal of #num# from a given node basically means that everything cancelled out and that this maps to maximum uncertainty anyways i don't want to give away too many details given that it's unpublished after a lot of time and effort theorizing and then experimenting with many variants of the formula i think i have something that works when i train a network with this new activation function in the output layer on for instance mnist and then test it on notmnist the resulting outputs seem much less overconfident than an equivalent network trained with softmax or sigmoid however the accuracy on mnist itself doesn't change much in fact on most tasks the new activation function gets very similar results to softmax when used in just the output layer so i'm not sure how useful it actually is there is one other place where it might affect performance though at this point i haven't tested this against the larger sota models i tried using it in place of softmax in the attention heads of a transformer network for language modelling the results seem promising but i don't know if it'll scale or work across more tasks than the toy problem i was able to run on a single gpu what i'd like to know from the experienced researchers here is whether or not this project is worth trying to make into a paper and publishing while i think i may have something here i'm not sure if that's my own bias of wanting all the time and effort spent to not be wasted another problem i'm finding is that over the course of the time that i've worked on this project i've accumulated many variants of the activation function and determining which one is actually the best on all tasks and scales is proving tricky for a while i was concerned that i had several versions

in various settings including fully observable partially observable i e with unobserved confounders markovian non markovian stationary smoothly non stationary and discrete distribution shifts uno can be useful in many critical applications that require thinking about metrics beyond the expected return for example medical settings where tail sensitive risk measures like value at risk cvar are essential to avoid catastrophic outcomes online recommendation where metrics like median inter quantiles are essential to tackle high noise in data collection or human machine interaction where metrics like variance entropy are essential to quantify uncertainty in the system's outcomes we believe that we have barely scratched the surface of this direction and we welcome any and all

maybe for a universal language embedding to be used for machine translation ok to begin with i am a complete beginner in deep learning and nlp my background is having completed the deep learning coursera specialization which i think is great by the way having read some blog post and watched some videos having played myself with an lstm language generator using a spanish corpus of my own so maybe what follows is too naive but this afternoon i had this idea after watching this talk about transformers #link# to finish with the background i'll add that i know that google has a kind of universal machine translator but as far as i have tried it it is not very good so i guess that there is still room for improvent ok here is the idea it's a multi step process #num# train an encoder decoder english language model a kind of autoencoder that aims to reproduce a given sentence having a bottleneck in the middle for the encoder all sota nlp techniques could be applied like using word embeddings transformers and whatever but the inner representation in the latent space should not be sequential as the order of a sequence is very language dependent and not language agnostic the aim of this first model will be to build a universal latent space in which meaning is preserved but not language dependent properties of text so maybe applying some fully connected layers and or convolutions could do in order to mix the sequential information into an unordered representation in the latent space #num# if the first step is reasonable achieved the most inner part of this model could be used as a universal representation of language how could we project other language onto this space well my idea is to do it in three steps #num# let's suppose that we are dealing with spanish first we will nedd a corpus of translated sentences from english to spanish as complete and accurate as possible #num# second we will train a model with exactly the same architecture of the first half of the first one but random inizializated weights maybe word embeddings could be initialized but that's all with the first half i mean that it only will have the encoder part not the decoder if we label the sentences as e#num# s#num# e#num# s#num# em sm being ei the english sentence and si the spanish translation the aim of the model will be mapping si to the latent representation of ei as accurate as possible the loss function could be suited for this regression task like a mean square loss after this training is finished we will have an spanish encoder that project spanish sentences in the same latent space as the first model #num# third we will train the spanish decoder whose aim will be like in the first model to map the latent representation to actual spanish sentences with the minimum loss of meaning in this part of the training the first part of the model the encoder will have the weights fixed because this weights are adjusted to preserve the map i believe that

management software for a team that currently has no data infrastructure hi all i'm a data analyst on a non technical team that collects and utilizes a lot of data because it's a non technical team there is essentially no data infrastructure set up specifically there is no data storage or management software being used we simply access our data directly in the file system the scope of our work has grown a lot recently and this way of doing things is quickly becoming unmanageable especially with respect to logging versioning and being able to find and reproduce old analyses so i'm wondering if it's time we use some actual software to help us with this i've been reading about data lakes our data is whole files can't be put into a relational database data warehouse i'm wondering if a data lake might help us however i've read that data lakes don't have any inherent structure to them and this is what allows them to store any type of data so what's the benefit of using data lake software services over just organizing our file system storage if i use a data lake will i still end up with the same question of how do i organize all this is there another type of software that i should be looking at that's more attuned to my needs keep in mind this is a non technical team so i will need to train any newcomer on whatever i use and can't assume they will have ds cs knowledge but they

actually understand the message you want to convey congratulations you\\u2019ve just finished the lesson plan use this checklist to make sure you\\u2019ve covered all the main topics for this subject manipulate data in excel know the basic functions create a dashboard in excel use macro and vba in excel types of variables mode median and mean range interquartile range and box plot variance and standard deviation z scores contingency table scatterplot pearson\\u2019s r basics of regression elementary probability random variables and probability distributions introduction to hypothesis testing role of the database write a query in sql know the basic functions upload data in tableau create dashboard and stories in tableau export reports in tableau use tableau as a viewer communicate data through a story here are the key takeaways of the lesson plan data analysts love working with numbers and presenting the data in a way that shows insight into the data set a data analyst also collects processes and performs statistical analyses on large dataset the analyst develops charts and creates visual presentations to help businesses make more strategic decisions by using tools as excel or tableau to be a data analyst you need both hard skills and soft skills below are some helpful questions to ask yourself when you begin formulating a plan to communicate your data #num# what

but i thought it was too simple i was looking around and i discovered gradient boost regression would gradient boost regression be too difficult to implement in sci kit learn is gradient boost regression a correct model for this type of dataset if not what other models should i look into what resources do you guys recommend for a beginner i collected about #num# rows of data and it has the

and we use ml in production for most parts like training deployments and serving we leverage aws sagemaker we have a nice pipeline written in python which gets the data from the warehouse applies transforms and initiates the training job everything automated however the difficult part comes when we have a new feature idea and the decision has to be taken whether or not to add it to the pipeline the idea is to get a quick analysis for the new feature or features currently we do this in a notebook where we randomly sample the actual training datasets train two models one with new features added and one without and compare the metric on the test set we do not initiate a complete training job as we think that might be an overkill i would like to understand from others int the

and scalable ml research experimentation with a list of best practices hello all i've been looking for a way to make my research more efficient and scalable after iterating over a couple of different frameworks and structures i converged on the following template #link# to get you a feel of how it might be useful for you take a look at #link# section of the readme it's based on pytorch lightning with hydra and its plugins i developed it for my research team but i also meant it as a starting point for anyone who would like to learn about this technology stack i find this combination simple to use but very powerful at the same time i believe it's very convenient for small team research reproducing papers implementing benchmarks and baselines and generally for projects in which you need to maintain many curated configurations of your experiments why i think this is awesome it allows us to painlessly scale from small experiments into hiperparameter search on multi gpu or slurm computing clusters with frameworks like optuna or ax the hyperparameter optimization requires minimal setup you only need to declare config with hyperparameter ranges and hydra takes care of the whole iterating over jobs logic possibility to use most experiment tracking frameworks like neptune wandb mlflow or just csv files easy configuration management with command line superpowers no need for argparse thanks to hydra advanced training and debugging features from pytorch lightning e g gradient accumualation deepspeed integration etc encapsulating datasets into lightning datamodules gives us a very convenient way for understanding and reusing datasets across projects i feel like most ml people don't use those tools because they simply don't realize all the advantages especially hydra seems like a very useful addition to any deep learning project i focused on structuring the readme in a way which i hope will give you a quick overview my hope is it can help to spread the word about those frameworks in a broaded community it incorporates #link# and tricks i gathered over the last couple of months of playing around with it my typical workflow is the following #num# i write a lightningdatamodule i found it to be an intuitive way to encapsulate any dataset lightningdatamodule is a simple abstraction providing methods for data download split transforms and exposing dataloaders would love to see more researchers try out this concept even in projects which don't use pytorch lightning reading lightningdatamodule makes me immedietely see how the dataset is prepared while it seems like most data science projects throw around data logic across different parts of the pipeline making it hard to understand what's going on you can see example of such datamodule #link# #num# i write a lightningmodule this basically just encapsulates my pytorch model code #num# i add new experiment config specifying the paths to the lightningdatamodule and lightningmodule now the training can be launched with some experiment tracker attached like csv logger or tensorboard `python` #link# `experiment simple_mnist logger tensorboard` btw the structure is partly based on data

in film post production and i have no prior deep learning coding experience but i wanted a gpu with a lot of memory to process high res imagery with an existing tensorflow based open source toolset that i could just about figure out how to use with my small amount of python experience i did secure a titan rtx off amazon at retail price but i decided to return it when i found out about the imminent release of the ampere cards because $#num# sounded a lot better than $#num# of course the #num# is going for around the same price as the #num# k rrp i paid for the rtx titan i was very naive at that exact moment about the fact that crypto mining was going to go back into full swing although i was warned by someone on this very sub i did expect eth proof of stake to cancel some of that out but we aren't there yet besides availability issues there was also the size of the #num# which nvidia seem to have intentionaly made huge so it can't fit in a typical deep learning rig or graphics workstation no problem i'll get a third party blower card if i can find one in stock whoops now nvidia killed them all alright now i'll look at one of those rinky dink third party rgb gamer cards that are sufficiently low profile i only need one card with #num# gb vram okay they are all sold out forever and if you can get one it may be as expensive as the previous titan so maybe it's best to get an a#num# or a#num# because tbh it seems they are more likely to go for rrp which makes them not a huge step up from the inflated #num# prices and they are better supported on linux imo i have just found out about the lhr cards though that will be shipping soon but also that there may not be a #num# lhr so it doesn't seem like supply will necessarily improve there is now a proprietary gui based toolset by the same developers which is now using pytorch as the back end but it's still recommended that #num# gb is where you really want to be at memory wise without needing to slice up the input images too much so this issue is not going anywhere i had managed to get a #num# super with #num# gb as an interim card which is really the bare minimum it's also comical how much those cards are going for now so i'm glad i snagged one of the last ones at best buy for $#num# rrp last year\",\n\"MachineLearning\",\n\"Discussion\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1914,\n            'f': \"1914\",\n

one dyskryminacje osob ktore nie chca sie szczepic ale powodem owej dyskryminacji jest zdecydowana odmowa solidarnosci spolecznej owych osob a takze lekcewazenie praw innych i tak jak przepisy ruchu drogowego moga i powinny byc wymuszane takze odbieraniem pewnych uprawnien na przyklad prawa jazdy tak zbiorowe bezpieczenstwo moze byc regulowane przy pomocy tego rodzaju rozporzadzen ale to nie wszystko warto sobie uswiadomic ze chcacemu nie dzieje sie krzywda jesli wiec ktos nie chce sie szczepic to jest jego akt wyboru ktory moze wiazac sie z tym ze nie bedzie on mial dostepu do pewnych uslug czy mozliwosci wyjazdu to jego wybor i nie powinien od miec do nikogo pretensji nie istnieja ani finansowe ani religijne powody do odmawiania szczepien panstwo gwarantuje darmowe szczepionki a wszystkie powazne wyznania chrzescijanskie a takze wielkie religie swiata nie tylko akceptuja ale i wspieraja szczepienia trudno tu wiec mowic o dyskryminacji finansowej czy swiatopogladowej a mozna mowic jedynie o konsekwencjach swoich wyborow juz teraz zreszta zeby wyjechac do niektorych krajow trzeba sie zaszczepic przeciwko chorobom tropikalnym w pewnych zawodach sa konieczne odpowiednie badania ktore umozliwiaja ich wykonanie czy to dyskryminacja nie po prostu egzekwowanie bezpiecznych zachowan i wreszcie kwestia ostatnia nikt nie mowi o przymusowym szczepieniu a jedynie o tym ze ci ktorzy sie nie zaszczepia wzglednie nie bede mieli swiadectwa o przejsciu choroby i lub niemozliwosci z powodow zdrowotnych szczepien to nie beda mogli w rownym stopniu korzystac z pewnych uslug a
